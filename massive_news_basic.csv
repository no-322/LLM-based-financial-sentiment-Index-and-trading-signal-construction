Opportunities Ahead But Be Astute
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Plenty of opportunities are ahead in 2024, but you need to be astute as to when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy if you want market beating returns.  
The chart shows that during the Santa Claus rally, the stock market did not hit the top band of the resistance zone. In the very short term, this is a negative.
The chart shows the stock market has pulled back to the low band of the resistance zone. To maintain bullish posture, the stock market needs to not go much below the bottom band of the resistance zone.
There are likely many stops right below the bottom band of the resistance zone.  If the stock market starts dropping, hunt and destroy algorithms will go into action and take out the stops. This is the reason that The Arora Report recommends not placing stops at obvious points.
Historically, after the stops are taken out, there is a bounce. Officially, the period for the Santa Claus rally will end at the close tomorrow.
RSI shown on the chart is on a sell signal, but the pattern is such that it can quickly reverse to a buy signal.
RSI on the chart shows negative divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI and the price are moving differently. This is a negative in the very short term.
In the early trade this morning, there is considerable tax related selling. Historically, such selling is common after a strong year. The reason is that investors did not want to sell in 2023 to avoid paying capital gains taxes for the 2023 tax year.  By selling now, they have successfully postponed paying capital gains tax by one year.
As the year starts, investors are again making the classic mistake that we warned you about late last year. The classic mistake investors make at this time of the year is to act on the following:

2024 year end targets from Wall Street strategists
Sector recommendations from Wall Street strategists


In our 40 years in the markets, a vast majority of the time, Wall Street strategists are wrong. To understand the recent history, consider the following:

Right now, investors are worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears.
In 2023 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabears and deriding permabulls. What did the stock market do? The stock market went up.
In 2022 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears. What did the stock market do? The stock market went down.

The tech sector played a notable role in dragging down the broader stock market performance. Interestingly, blue-chip and small-cap stocks managed to dodge substantial losses, showing marginal gains.

Note the following:

The chart shows tech stocks have fallen back into the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows tech stocks are near oversold.
The stock market has a consensus now that everything is going to be immaculate – the landing, the Fed, interest rates, earnings, adoption of AI, Russia, China, and the Middle East.
The stock market is assuming a 90% probability of seven rate cuts.
The stock market is going to face new economic data today:

ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 47.1%.
JOLTS report will be released at 10am ET.


The stock market will also face minutes from the last FOMC meeting at 2pm ET. Powell was dovish in the press conference, flipping 180 degrees. At The Arora Report, we will be reading the Fed minutes to see if the 180 degree flip was unanimous or if there was dissension.
If the new data and the Fed minutes are supportive of immaculate everything, expect a rip roaring rally and new highs.
If the data is not supportive of immaculate everything, expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to try to run up the stock market.
Market mechanics are neutral as of this writing in the premarket but can easily swing in either direction after the data and Fed minutes.
Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has made two key points this morning:

Rate hikes are not off the table.
The soft landing is at risk.

The “magnificent seven” stocks — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) — collectively represent about 30% of the S&P 500’s market cap.

2024-01-08T20:05:09Z,AAPL,"Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy noted that Mobileye Global Inc (NASDAQ: MBLY) is the latest casualty in the slowing automotive end market. 
The analyst noted that while semiconductor content increases in automobiles are a clear trend, supply has generally caught up to demand. 
Shorter lead times, increasing inventory, higher interest rates, and rising sticker prices are causing a demand slowdown. The analyst flagged that this slower demand environment is continuing.
Cassidy expected to learn some details on the current automotive market at CES this week. 
The analyst will meet with companies with automotive exposure, including Ambarella, Innoviz, Navitas, onsemi, Qualcomm, and Synaptics. 
Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been aggressively updating its Snapdragon XR Platform for many years. 
Cassidy noted Qualcomm as being the leader in virtual reality SoCs. 
Qualcomm's advantage is the pricing, technology, and ecosystem of support leveraged from the Snapdragon core design refined over years of high-volume production in handsets. 
The virtual reality headset market will eventually find the correct feature set that meets consumers' needs, as per Cassidy.
Arm Holdings Plc's (NASDAQ: ARM) licensing pipeline for generative AI licenses is strengthening based on Cassidy's checks in Asia and Silicon Valley in December, which is additive to the already rich v9 architecture roadmap, share gains in PC, DC, and significant royalty rate increases complemented by the new CSS program.

2024-01-09T12:35:05Z,AAPL,"Monday’s stock rally, while impressive, may face a brief respite as index futures hint at a potential return to the downtrend on Tuesday. Traders are approaching the market with caution, evaluating the gains from the previous session. The upcoming days hold several crucial catalysts, with the focus shifting to the Wednesday release of the consumer price inflation report and Friday’s eagerly anticipated big bank earnings.
Despite the cautious mood, potential factors like a billion-dollar tech merger and the swirling optimism around a spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund approval, coupled with the spike in oil prices, could inject some buying activity.
Cues From Monday’s Trading:
Monday witnessed a robust advancement in U.S. stocks, driven by a strong rebound in the technology sector, lifting the broader market. Both the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite started on a positive note, steadily gaining momentum throughout the session and closing with substantial increases.
The Dow Industrials, comprising 30 stocks, initially faced a setback, primarily due to Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) dragging down the index. This followed federal regulators’ recommendation to ground 737 Max 9s after an Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) plane experienced a midflight blowout. However, the index managed to recover from the early dip and concluded with a modest gain. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) spearheaded the rebound in the Dow.

2024-01-11T19:10:46Z,AAPL,"It’s a bearish Thursday on Wall Street, with stocks relinquishing their gains due to unexpectedly high inflation numbers for December, causing some turbulence in market expectations regarding earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts.
During the previous month, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 3.4% compared to the previous year, surpassing the forecasted 3.2% increase. Core inflation stood at 3.9% annually, exceeding the expected 3.8%, primarily driven by the persistent high costs of shelter.
Latest Fed remarks had a chilling effect on the markets. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin indicated his willingness to consider rate reductions once inflation is on track to reach 2%, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester expressed the view that March might be too early for a rate cut.
In response, traders adjusted their expectations for interest rates, with the implied probability of a March rate cut falling from 70% to around 63%, while maintaining their overall bet of six rate cuts throughout 2024.
Meanwhile, Treasury yields remained relatively stable, while the U.S. dollar strengthened by 0.2%.

The re-rating reflected a more robust multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by the need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features likely for introduction in 2024 and 2025 (a large part of the installed base is still on iPhone 11). 
The analyst noted higher service growth as Apple better monetized its installed base, adding that the  silicon roadmap will morph from PC to Servers to Autonomous, driving higher margins.
Mohan also flagged strong capital returns (buybacks, dividends) even after approaching net cash neutral.
He emphasized that the gross margin is stable to higher over time (mix, price, vertical integration).

2024-01-19T05:40:18Z,AAPL,"Noted economist, Steve Hanke, has predicted a recession, a stock market downturn, and inflation falling below 2% by the end of 2024.
What Happened: Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, suggests that the stock market is overvalued and will likely see a decline as the anticipated recession begins to impact,  reported Business Insider on Thursday.
“As far as the outlook for stocks goes, they remain pricey, and the multiples will come off as the recession starts to bite,” said Hanke.
The S&P 500 index, after a 24% surge in 2023, is currently trading near an all-time high. Hanke, however, cautions that stocks, usually valued at multiples to company earnings, are expected to drop during a recession due to decreasing multiples and reducing earnings.
Hanke, who served as an economic advisor to Ronald Reagan and was the president of Toronto Trust Argentina in 1995, attributes the recent unstable inflation to alterations in the U.S. money supply rather than supply-chain disruptions or variations in energy and metal prices.

2024-01-22T02:45:04Z,AAPL,"The stock market is showing signs of a forthcoming investment opportunity, according to a recent report by Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA). The firm’s deputy CIO, Dan Suzuki, believes that the current market signals could lead to a significant shift in investment dynamics.
What Happened: Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA) has been signaling a potential investment opportunity amidst concerning signs in the stock market, reported Business Insider. The firm has been predicting a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity for months, and it appears to be on the verge of realization.
According to RBA’s Deputy CIO Dan Suzuki, the market’s current situation, particularly the dominance of a few stocks, could lead to a broader market shift. The firm’s thesis, proposed at the end of last year, suggests that the extraordinary market leadership of a small group of stocks will expand to the wider market, resulting in stronger gains for the other 493 S&P 500 stocks.
However, Suzuki warned that the corporate earnings of major tech companies are expected to decelerate in the next quarter. Only three of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” — Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/01/36710497/stock-markets-once-in-a-generation-opportunity-is-near-says-bernstein-analyst-you-a

Here's a look at the history of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and how much an investment at launch would be worth today.
What Happened: Launched with seed funding of $6.5 million, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust became the first U.S. ETF on Jan. 22, 1993.
The ETF was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission several years after State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) applied for the fund.
Initial interest in the ETF was poor and the fund was almost closed before investors came around to the idea of using ETFs as investment vehicles.
The success of the SPY ETF led to other financial institutions launching similar ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index, one of the largest and most well-known stock market indexes.

He cited the performance of homebuilders like Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN), Toll Brothers Inc (NYSE:TOL), and PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM), which have seen significant gains despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes.

What Happened: Amundi, with $2 trillion under management, anticipates a less robust economic growth in the upcoming year, which could result in a weaker performance from the leading mega-cap stocks, reported Business Insider on Saturday.
In a panel discussion at the New York Stock Exchange, Craig Sterling, the head of equity research at Amundi U.S., stated that the firm is underweight on U.S. stocks for 2024. He highlighted the significant difference between the current stock market and that of a year ago.
Despite the S&P 500’s impressive 25% surge in 2023, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), were the primary drivers of this growth.

2024-01-29T12:23:09Z,AAPL,"U.S. stocks are poised for a mixed start on Monday ahead of a deluge of big tech earnings, with optimism surrounding tech earnings likely providing support to the market. This week, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all set to report their quarterly results, and analysts anticipate that AI-focused companies will outperform expectations, potentially sustaining the equity market rally.
Despite this optimism, investors may exercise caution leading up to a two-day Federal Reserve meeting beginning on Tuesday. While economists expect the Fed to maintain the current high rate, traders will be attentive to signals regarding the trajectory of interest rates. Meanwhile, the Chinese market continues to experience volatility, driven by concerns about its troubled property sector.
Cues From Last Week’s Trading:
In the week ending on Jan. 26, major stock indices saw gains for a third consecutive week, buoyed by optimism surrounding the economy, inflation, and earnings. Key drivers included preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data highlighting the economy’s strength, varied earnings reports, and the December personal consumption expenditure index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.
The S&P 500 Index reached record levels for four sessions during the week, concluding just below the record, while the Dow Industrials closed the week in record territory.

What Happened: Microsoft’s shares have surged by 7% in 2024, propelling its market value above $3 trillion and surpassing Apple as the world’s most valuable company, reported Reuters on Monday. As of Friday, Microsoft’s market capitalization was slightly higher than Apple’s.
All 13 investment strategists and portfolio managers consulted by Reuters last week believe that Microsoft will outperform Apple in the next five years, despite potential share price and valuation fluctuations following the quarterly results of both companies.

2024-01-29T14:02:53Z,AAPL,"Markets are primed for a revival in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2024 following the worst performance in almost a decade for deal-making in 2023.
Equity and M&A experts believe that, after a year beset by volatile markets and rising interest rates, 2024 offers improving conditions for takeover deals and corporate mergers.
“Capital markets were not as open or freewheeling, and 2023 did not happen the way we thought it would,"" said Tom Miles, Head of Americas M&A at Morgan Stanley. 
“The market forces are in place that make an eventual return inevitable. It's not a question of if but when.”
One piece of the M&A jigsaw that was largely missing last year was private equity (PE) firms. These players use leveraged buyout methods to take poorly performing publicly traded companies private. The goal is to exit via an IPO or sell off the assets at a profit.
Pitchbook analyst Tim Clarke noted how higher interest rates made it more costly for PE firms to engage in deals.
“PE's share of M&A has no doubt been constrained by reduced access to leverage,” he said. During 2023, PE involvement was the lowest total recorded going back to 2005.
Overall volumes of M&A dropped to $2.4 trillion in 2023, down from $3.1 trillion in 2022 and $5.2 trillion at its 2021 peak.
But analysts at Morgan Stanley expect both corporate and PE deal-making to be stronger in 2024 after the fourth-quarter rally on equity markets in 2023.
“Corporate balance sheets are strong, financing markets are improving and CEO confidence, which is closely correlated with M&A activity, is climbing,” said Miles.
Which sectors, then, can investors expect to lead this increase in M&A activity.

2024-01-29T14:31:38Z,AAPL,"The United States’ trade policies under President Joe Biden have left European officials feeling apprehensive as they see a continuation of the protectionist stance adopted by his predecessor, Donald Trump.
What Happened: The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that despite Biden’s “America is back” declaration, his administration has maintained many of Trump’s protectionist policies. This includes keeping trade barriers in place, excluding European companies from U.S. manufacturing subsidies, and imposing stricter restrictions on Chinese access to American technology.
European diplomats are concerned that the U.S.’s economic policies, regardless of the election outcome, are no longer in their favor. This has led to doubts about the U.S.’s commitment to the rules-based trading system and the potential for economic conflict between the long-standing allies.

2024-01-30T07:00:22Z,AAPL,"The U.S. economy could be on the verge of a significant stock market crash and a year-long recession, according to market strategist Jon Wolfenbarger.
What Happened: Wolfenbarger, a seasoned market observer, anticipates a severe drop in the U.S. stock market and a prolonged recession. Wolfenbarger, with over three decades of investing experience, relies on a variety of economic indicators that suggest an impending downturn, according to a Business Insider report Tuesday.
Wolfenbarger, the founder of Bull and Bear Profits and a former JPMorgan banker, is particularly concerned about the consistent decline of The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index and the longest stretch of an inverted yield curve in more than half a century. His forecast is more severe than The Conference Board’s, which predicts a two-quarter recession.
“The depth of the latest yield curve inversion has only been matched or exceeded by those preceding the Great Depression and the major recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s,” said Wolfenbarger.

What Happened: Munster took to X, formerly Twitter, and referenced a Wall Street Journal article on Meta's readiness to take on Apple in the headset war.

The Meta Analyst: Justin Patterson reiterated an Overweight rating on Meta shares and upped his price target by 22% from $380 to $465
KeyBanc’s updated price target is just shy of the Street-high number of Mizuho Securities at $470.
The Meta Thesis: “Meta ended the year with further momentum in its ad products, particularly Reels,” said Patterson. The analyst said the Reels short-video offering from Meta’s stable was now successfully competing with connected-TV for linear-TV budgets.
Q4 Estimates: When the Mark Zuckerberg-led company reports its quarterly results Thursday after the market close, KeyBanc expects revenue of $39.9 billion, marking 24% year-over-year growth and a 2% beat versus the consensus.

The team’s recent findings indicate a concerning concentration of market power in the hands of the top 10 stocks on the MSCI USA Index, reminiscent of the worrisome market conditions seen two decades ago.
As Bloomberg reported Tuesday, the combined share of the MSCI USA Index’s top 10 stocks, including the prominent ‘Magnificent Seven’ technology giants, has escalated to a significant 29.3% in December. This figure approaches the historical peak of 33.2% witnessed in June 2000, during the height of the dot-com bubble.
Diversity within these top ranks is also dwindling, with only four sectors represented, a stark contrast to the historical median of six. This lack of diversification heightens the vulnerability of the market to shocks in these sectors.

Despite a successful launch, Vision Pro didn’t fly off shelves as rapidly as expected, with extended shipping times indicating initial inventory sell-out. 
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated 160,000 to 180,000 units sold during pre-orders, expressing concerns about sustained demand as shipping times remained unchanged 48 hours after pre-orders opened.

Q1 Beat Likely: Ives anticipates a first-quarter beat, considering the prevailing pessimistic sentiments. The negative narrative surrounding Apple has grown over the past year due to a lack of iPhone unit growth, causing many investors to question Cupertino’s future growth story, notes the analyst.
Key Items Of Interest: Ives points out that Wall Street will likely focus on iPhone revenue and the Services segment’s performance. Both are expected to have fared well during the December quarter, with consensus estimates for iPhone and Services revenue at $68 billion and $23 billion, respectively.

*according to Benzinga Pro data
Apple’s first-quarter guidance issued in early November called for 2023-December quarter revenue to be flat with the year-ago period. This is despite having one less selling week than in the fourth quarter of 2022, said CFO Luca Maestri. He also flagged a one-percentage-point negative impact from forex. Since then, the U.S. dollar has weakened, potentially hurting the company less. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s move against a basket of currencies, slid 4.36% in the December quarter amid expectations of Fed rate cuts.
Apple modeled a gross margin of 45% to 46%.
In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said he expects a healthy December quarter beat, with revenue and earnings per share likely coming in at $119  billion and $2.13, respectively.
Apple Product Categories: Roughly 50% of revenue comes from Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone. The company hinted at revenue growth for the product, on an absolute basis as well, after normalizing for both last year’s supply disruptions and the one extra week.

2024-02-01T12:27:35Z,AAPL,"With the Fed decision now in the rearview mirror, sentiment appears to have taken a turn for the better on the hopes of receiving strong earnings reports from some high-profile tech companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Given the Federal Reserve’s data-dependent stance, a couple of manufacturing activity data and the routine jobless claims data due for the day could draw traders’ attention.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, stung by the double-whammy of earnings disappointments and a hawkish Fed. Traders reacted negatively to earnings from Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), all of which have significant weightings in the S&P 500 Index.
The major indices started the session lower and moved roughly sideways until the Fed decision. The Dow was seen moving in and out of the unchanged line as it received support from a strong upward move in Boeing Co.’s (NYSE:BA) shares. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indices languished in negative territory.
Following the rate decision, the indices either moved above the flat line or trimmed their losses. Jerome Powell disappointed traders by offering no clear signal toward a rate-cut schedule, so they dumped stocks in late afternoon trading.
The S&P 500 Index pulled further away from its record close, with the broader gauge and the Nasdaq Composite settling at the lowest levels in about two weeks. 
The market witnessed a broad-based sell-off, with communications stocks being the worst hit. IT, consumer discretionary, and energy stocks also saw marked weakness.

Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market has pulled back on Powell’s remarks.
The chart shows the stock market is near the top band of the support zone.
The chart shows that in the early trade, the dip in the stock market is being bought.
The FOMC rate decision came as expected yesterday. However, Powell trampled on the speculation of a rate cut in March. Please read yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule for details.
Fed Chair Powell said labor availability is a big factor in the Fed’s decision.
Previously, the Fed was trying to drive unemployment higher. The reason was in traditional economics, higher unemployment brings down inflation.
This cycle has defied traditional economics thus far. Inflation is coming down while unemployment remains very low.
In The Arora Report analysis of Powell’s press conference, the Fed is not worried about inflation running back up. However, the Fed is concerned about inflation being sticky and staying above their target. If the employment picture stays strong, it will be difficult for the Fed to cut interest rates as the Fed does not want inflation to get stuck above their target. This is the reason prudent investors are paying very close attention to the jobs report.
The jobs report, known as the mother of all reports, will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.
In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report tomorrow is the key to the near-term direction of the stock market. If the jobs report is strong, the stock market will likely tumble. If the jobs report is weak, the stock market will likely run up. 
Weekly initial jobless claims came at 224K vs. 215K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is still very strong, but the data is beginning to weaken.
Q4 Productivity-Prel came at 3.2% vs. 2.1% consensus.

What Happened: The Apple Vision Pro has been eagerly anticipated by Apple fans and augmented reality enthusiasts for years, and they will finally be able to get their hands on the headsets Friday with a starting price of $3,499.
""Vision Pro is a new kind of computer that augments reality, (it) will change the way we collaborate, work, enjoy entertainment,"" Cook said when unveiling the device.
Cook recalled his first experience with the Vision Pro six to eight years ago, before it had its current name, according to an interview with Vanity Fair.

2024-02-02T12:24:06Z,AAPL,"Stock futures are pointing upwards on Friday as traders assess earnings reports from Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Earnings remain mixed, raising concerns about both the economy and corporate profit growth. The non-farm payrolls report for January, anticipated before the market opens, is expected to heavily influence the day’s trading direction. A stronger-than-expected job gains report and/or any spike in wage growth could potentially reignite inflation fears, triggering selling pressure in the market.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
Optimism preceding tech earnings and some favorable economic data contributed to gains across major averages on Thursday. The indices opened higher and remained range-bound in a sideways move until late-morning trading, with the Dow Industrials briefly dipping below the unchanged line. Subsequently, stocks initiated a rally and concluded near the session highs.
The majority of sectors displayed solid advancements during the session, illustrating the breadth of the rally, although energy stocks experienced some pullback.

Blowout Jobs Report And Earnings
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a rally after a shallow pullback.
The chart shows that the shallow pullback approached but did not penetrate the high band of the support zone. From a technical perspective this is a positive.
The chart shows an attempt of a new breakout. This new breakout would have likely followed through if it was not for the jobs report data upsetting bulls’ hopium this morning.
The jobs report is a blowout. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 353K vs. 175K consensus.
Non-farm private payrolls came at 317K vs. 150K consensus.
Unemployment rate came at 3.7% vs. 3.8% consensus.
Average work week came at 34.1 vs. 34.4 consensus.


This is the strongest jobs report since January 2023.
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report is simply too strong for the Fed to cut rates. Even though Powell was clear that a rate cut in March was not the base case, stock market bulls have continued to buy stocks on hopes of a rate cut in March.  
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report significantly upsets stock market bulls’ hopium. If it was not for the blowout earnings from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), the stock market would have likely fallen by as much as 1000 DJIA points on this report.  Now the questions for prudent investors are the following:
In view of blowout earnings from AMZN and META, will the momo crowd even care about the jobs report?

Will the new narrative of momo gurus that interest rates no longer matter ring true with investors?  
Layoffs helped AMZN and META report blowout earnings. If the premarket gains hold, META and AMZN have added about $275B in market cap since they reported earnings after the close yesterday.  


META is initiating its first dividend and a $50B buyback. The addition of a dividend and the buyback to stellar earnings is resulting in META stock running up 17.15% since it reported earnings to the time of this writing. This ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/02/36913908/jobs-report-upsets-bulls-hopium-but-they-might-not-care-layoffs-help-meta-and-amazon-add-275b-in-mar

2024-02-05T18:19:42Z,AAPL,"Technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its highly anticipated Apple Vision Pro headsets on Friday in a move that could advance the world of virtual reality.
The long-running animated comedy “The Simpsons” may have predicted what happens when people wear virtual reality headsets at home and in public.
What Happened: Since the Vision Pro was released, images have gone viral of people wearing the headset on the street or the train. A driver of a Tesla vehicle was even pulled over wearing the Apple Vision Pro while driving.
While a world filled with people all wearing headsets in public could be years or decades away, ""The Simpsons"" may have predicted the disasters that could happen.
A clip from the 2016 episode titled ""Friends and Family"" went viral on X, formerly known as Twitter, over the weekend with more than eight million views. In the clip, residents of the fictional town of Springfield are seen wearing a virtual reality headset and subsequently running into light posts, falling down a manhole and laying in bed with a headset on next to a significant other also wearing a headset.
The clip features the Cream song ""I Feel Free"" playing in the background alluding to a world where headsets and virtual reality have taken over real-life interactions.

However, he also noted that the typical hurdles most first-generation products face also hold for the Vision Pro (weight and battery life). 
The spatial computing paradigm is unique and expects developers to unleash numerous apps to drive increased use cases over time.
Based on his assumptions, the Vision Pro hardware can add 46 cents per share to EPS over the next five years.

(NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The group saw its combined worth surpass the total economic output of global cities such as New York, Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Seoul, Chicago, San Francisco, Osaka and Shanghai, as highlighted by Michael Hartnett, Bank of America’s chief market strategist, in a recent note.
The stocks are now testing the “law of physics,” Bloomberg columnists John Authers and Isabelle Lee wrote on Monday. Ed Yardeni, a popular Wall Street industry veteran, said “the Mag-7 once again are sucking all the air out of the universe,” in a recent note addressing the spectacular jump of Meta Platforms.
Last Friday, the social media giant owned by Mark Zuckerberg made a historic $204-billion market value jump in a single day, the largest for any U.S. company ever.

This comes as a surprise in the backdrop of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. (OTCPK: SSNLF), the world's largest Android phone maker, losing its crown to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) after a blemish-free run at the top for 13 years.

What Happened: The judge's decision came after a Tesla shareholder challenged the compensation plan that tied Musk’s earnings to the performance of Tesla metrics like market capitalization, revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
The shareholder argued proper disclosures were not presented to investors before the plan was approved by shareholders and the company's board.

What Happened: Data, provided by Nasdaq eVestment showed that among the worst-performing strategies was the equity long-short fund — where hedge fund managers buy stocks they think will perform well and bet against stocks they believe are likely to fall.
Indeed, investors have pulled more than $150 billion from this type of fund over the past five years as they have underperformed the market in nine of the past 10 years.
The equity long-short fund has been around for decades and was generally successful during periods of broadly calm market conditions as so-called “star stock pickers” were able to capitalize strongly on market fluctuations by buying long and selling short.
When more turbulent conditions persist, it becomes much more difficult for stock pickers to predict. One of the chief problems for pickers last year, however, was the expectation that several mega-cap stocks had become so overvalued that they had become ripe for shorting.

In a far-reaching paper on money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal financial activities, the Treasury Department said that the relative stability of the U.S. real estate market and its historic reputation as a reliable store of long-term value has traditionally attracted both legitimate interest and those looking to find a reliable mechanism to launder money.

The “Magnificent 7” mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently account for 29% of the S&P 500.
Although a potential decline in demand for these stocks poses a risk, Belski is confident that the broader market can still yield positive returns even if the mega-cap tech stocks falter.
“Our work shows that the stock market has held up just fine in prior periods when the outperformance of mega-cap stocks started to wane,” Belski said.
“In fact, the only period where the index posted a loss occurred in 2001 (Tech Bubble), and as we mentioned quite frequently in recent reports, we do not ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/02/36997982/top-strategist-shrugs-off-magnificent-7-concentration-risks-stock-market-has-held-u
2024-02-08T06:14:49Z,AAPL,"The Magnificent Seven group has been the flavor of Wall Street over the past year, as these stocks led the stock market to rebound from 2022’s dismal performance. 
Here’s a look at how much return an investment in a basket comprising the Magnificent seven stocks in equal proportion would have fetched vis-a-vis Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK).
New Group On The Block: FAANG was the precursor to the group, now collectively called the Magnificent Seven. Originally named FANG by Jim Cramer in 2013, the group became known as FAANG with the addition of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2017. The original members were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which then went by the name Facebook, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), formerly Google.
Later iterations were MAGA, which included Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, and MAMAA, comprising Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
The phrase Magnificent Seven was first used by BofA Securities analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023. The constituent companies spearheaded the stock market rebound during the year, thanks to the dominant market positioning, innovativeness, brand appeal and financial muscle of these companies. This group comprises the biggest mega-cap techs including Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

S&P 500 At 5000
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that S&P 500 is comfortably above the top band of the support zone.  
The chart shows that the move up is on lower volume. This is a negative. 
Historically, when S&P 500 hits the next 1000 benchmark, the median return is as follows:

0.57% after one week
2.00% after one month
3.5% after three months
7.73% after six months


The above data is only history, and no one should depend on it. It is more important to understand how various groups behave.  

Sentiment moves higher in the extreme zone.
Momo crowd buying becomes even more aggressive.
Mom and pop who are normally not active in the stock market jump in.
Bears throw in the towel and jump in.
Underperforming money managers become aggressive buyers.
Smart money takes advantage of the strength and trims positions. 


“Buy low and sell high” is a simple concept in theory. This is exactly what you need to do to consistently beat the stock market. However, in practice it is not as easy as it sounds for the following reasons:

Human emotions of fear and greed.
Market mechanics
Market controlled by momo crowd
Momo gurus
Short squeezes
Thousands of constantly changing variables from across the globe


The key is to look at returns, not only in terms of absolute returns, but in terms of risk adjusted returns.
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

The chart shows the revised CPI data brought in buyers to the stock market.
The chart shows that volume continues to be low. This indicates that so far there is lack of conviction in the move. However, this can change very quickly.
The stock market has been eagerly waiting for CPI revisions as there have been times in the past when such revisions caused major moves in the stock market.
A year ago, when inflation appeared to be coming down, revisions completely changed the picture.
As of this writing, the complete data is not yet available. Here are the details known so far:

Q4 Core CPI is unchanged at 3.3% annualized.
December CPI revised to 0.2% from 0.3%.
December Core CPI is unchanged at 0.3%.


Bond yields are slightly lower after the CPI revisions.
The sum total of the revision data so far is positive for the stock market.
As more data becomes available, it may move the stock market. CPI for January will be released next Tuesday at 8:30am ET.

The Apple Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has an “Outperform” rating and a $250 price target for Apple shares.
The Apple Thesis: New Asia supply chain checks show a “clear stabilization” demand in China, with iPhone units expected to show “incremental growth,” said Ives in a note. This validates the analyst’s prediction of the iPhone 15 triggering an upgrade cycle that surpasses Street expectations.
Investors reacted negatively to Apple’s quarterly results released in early February, as the China region reported a year-over-year revenue decline.
The analyst now expects iPhone unit sales of 225 million to 230 million units for this year and the average selling price of its flagship device to exceed $900, given the product mix shift moving toward the two high-end models.

Small Caps

Note the following:

The chart shows the 2021 high in small caps.
The chart shows the high in small caps in 2023.
The chart shows small caps are still well below the 2021 high.
Small caps staged a big rally in 2023, but small caps have not rocketed to new highs like the S&P 500. This may be an opportunity for investors. Here is what investors should keep in mind:

IWM could be a catch up trade.
On the other hand, small caps should have performed better than they have.The difference could be explained due to the lack of high flying AI stocks in IWM, or the difference could be a warning.
Small caps are interest rate sensitive and should do well when the Fed cuts rates.
Small caps are economically sensitive. As such, small caps should do well if there is no landing.
IWM includes many banks. If there is no banking crisis, IWM should do well.
If the overall stock market maintains its gains, small caps provide an opportunity to investors.


Fed speak is ahead. The Fed’s Michelle Bowman, Tom Barkin, and Neel Kashkari will be speaking today.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released Tuesday at 8:30am ET. The stock market is assuming that inflation will continue to go down. If CPI shows that inflation is continuing to come down, S&P 500 will rally. On the other hand, if CPI is stronger than expected, there is a lot of air in the stock market and as such may lead to a rapid pullback.

Hotter Inflation
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a slight pullback on inflation data.
The chart shows volume continues to be low, indicating lack of conviction.
The volume today will be a tell. If the stock market pulls back on heavy volume on bad inflation data, that will be an indication that the bulls are losing control. On the other hand, if the stock market has only a shallow pullback or goes up on lower volume, that will be an indication that bulls continue to be in control.
CPI was worse than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% month-over-month vs. 0.2% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% month-over-month vs. 0.3% consensus.


In yesterday’s Morning Capsule, we shared with you:

Momo gurus are already being proactive to prevent a selloff if the data shows that inflation is not coming down. The new mantra of momo gurus is that stocks will go up even if inflation does not come down. Keep in mind that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market under the disguise of analysis.


Momo gurus are extremely clever. Realizing that their new narrative was not that good, now they have come up with a more persuasive narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The new narrative is that this rise in inflation is a one-off.
The CPI data today shows that Powell’s fear of Burns’ blunder is justified. Arthur Burns was the most intelligent Fed Chairman. He lowered rates when inflation came down but was forced to raise rates again when inflation picked up again. This is known as Burns’ blunder.
New earnings are having an impact on the stock market.

Analysts at Wedbush have drawn a striking analogy to describe the impact of AI, likening a standout company in the AI arena to football legend Lionel Messi, while still labelling NVIDIA Corp.‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Jensen Huang as the pioneering ‘Godfather of AI.’
Rise Of AI Investments
Daniel Ives and his team at Wedbush predict a surge in technological investments towards AI in the coming decade. This anticipation stems from the evident monetization of AI technologies, as demonstrated in recent earnings reports across the tech sector.

Kumar noted that the IoT business in the longer term could ultimately provide Qualcomm with $1.5 billion+ in quarterly revenues further down the line as more industrial-edge devices come online.
The analyst noted that Qualcomm’s automotive business exiting fiscal 2024 is up ~30% Y/Y. Additionally, his projections see the auto segment exiting fiscal 2025 with $3 billion in annual revenues, well on track to meet management’s expectations.

UBER is a prime example and a key reminder to investors that there are opportunities beyond the magnificent seven and AI. While the magnificent seven stocks and AI have been driving the stock market, there are opportunities for investors in less expensive stocks with better potential for risk adjusted returns. The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc.

There is apparently a new serious national security threat. Read the section on Russia below.

2024-02-16T16:05:55Z,AAPL,"Bank of America Chief Market Strategist Michael Hartnett has drawn a compelling parallel between the current surge in the U.S. “Magnificent Seven” stocks and historical market bubbles dating back to the 18th century.
Hartnett’s insights reveal that while every bubble is unique, they share common catalysts such as technological innovation, new markets and, notably, central bank easing. These elements have historically converged to inflate asset prices beyond sustainable levels.
The AI bubble, for example, was ignited by the Federal Reserve’s response to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and the subsequent rise of ChatGPT. This scenario mirrors past bubbles such as the Plaza Accord’s effect on Japan and the internet bubble fueled by the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis. 
Similarly, policy stimuli in response to the COVID-19 pandemic inflated crypto and tech stocks, reminiscent of the Mississippi and South Sea Company bubbles sparked by changes to English usury laws in 1714.

Hotter Inflation

Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AMAT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
As we have been sharing with you, Applied Materials is the best “picks and shovels” play in artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence needs more sophisticated chips. To manufacture more sophisticated chips, companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) are buying more sophisticated equipment to manufacture the chips. Applied Materials is a big beneficiary.
The chart shows the big jump in AMAT stock on earnings.
RSI on the chart shows that AMAT is overbought.
The power of the demand for AI is reflected in the following earnings details from AMAT:

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 vs. $1.90 consensus.
The company reported revenue of $6.71B vs. $6.48B consensus.
The company is forecasting revenue for the current quarter with a midpoint of $6.5B vs. $6.34B consensus.


The strength in AMAT is pushing tech stocks higher, especially AI stocks.
The rise in AMAT stock shows that “picks and shovels” is a great strategy.  
Producer Price Index (PPI) came hotter than expected, just as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) did on Tuesday. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.1% consensus.

2024-02-16T16:47:09Z,AAPL,"Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report its fourth-quarter results on February 21. Analysts offered their take on the upcoming results.
Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson maintained Nvidia with an Outperform and raised the price target from $600 to $800.
The analyst noted that Nvidia will surpass estimates again and raise future guidance. During his mid-December travels in Asia, component suppliers and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) indicated strong quarter trends. 
They predicted further growth in the first quarter, with potential concerns about Cloud Service Providers (CSP) growth slowing in late 2024.

However, recent earnings reports from CSPs show continued momentum in AI infrastructure spending, with many large data center operators planning to increase capital expenditure in 2024, primarily for AI investments.
Bryson’s recent discussions with memory vendors revealed a continued high demand for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), with Nvidia expected to be the largest consumer of these components in 2024. 
The fourth quarter also saw significant capital raises for AI startups, which will likely benefit AI infrastructure providers either through direct purchases of AI systems or by renting AI infrastructure.
Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) reported a significant sales acceleration during the quarter, with growth in backlog driven by AI sales. 
His recent talks with other major server Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) echoed similar sentiments, noting improved sales momentum ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/02/37182843/whats-going-on-with-nvidia-stock-friday

Tepid Consumer
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of WMT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based, and Walmart is the largest retailer in the U.S. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to Walmart.
The chart shows the stock is going higher as of this writing.
The chart shows when Walmart reported earnings. Walmart beat earnings estimates for the last quarter. Here are the details:

Q4 revenue came at $173.4B vs. $158.4B consensus.
Walmart hit $100B in e-commerce sales.
Q1 adjusted EPS came at $1.48-$1.56 vs. $1.48 consensus.
Dividend increased by 9%.


The stock market has held up, in part, due to excess consumer spending.
Stock market bulls are counting on excess consumer spending continuing.
Walmart earnings are painting a tepid picture of the consumer. Walmart says shoppers are staying “choiceful.” The data from Walmart runs counter to stock market bulls’ hopium of the consumer continuing to spend excessively.
Walmart stock is running up, in part, because Walmart is buying Vizio Holding Corp (NYSE: VZIO) to expand advertising. VZIO is in the ZYX Buy portfolio that surrounds the Model Portfolio, and VZIO is the 191st Arora Portfolio company to be bought out.

As one of Wall Street’s oldest stock indicators, the DJIA doesn’t get shaken up often. The last member to join was Walgreens in 2018 when it replaced  General Electric, which enjoyed a 111-year tenure. Still, membership carries a certain prestige. Or does it?
“I remember when this would have mattered,” Scott Nations, founder of Nations Indexes, said on social media following the announcement.

So, does membership of this elite club still matter?

2024-02-21T17:02:56Z,AAPL,"Six out of the 10 largest holdings in over 700 aggregated hedge fund portfolios are increasingly concentrated towards the ‘Magnificent Seven' stocks, with Tesla being the sole exception, according to the latest report by Goldman Sachs.
What Happened: Insights from Goldman Sachs’ Hedge Fund Trend Monitor, an analysis led by Ben Snider, show an overzealous preference for just several mega-caps. This enthusiasm does not mirror their market weight. 
The Magnificent Seven accounts for a record 13% of the aggregate hedge fund long portfolios. Yet, it remains significantly underweighted compared to a 26% collective stake in the Russell 3000 — underscoring a cautious approach towards mega-cap equities.

What Happened: On Wednesday, Cramer commended Nvidia for its record revenue, which saw a 265% increase due to high demand for its AI products. He also lauded Amazon for its growing advertising and web services sector, reported CNBC.
""To me, a longer-term vision is what's required,"" Cramer said. 
""Too bad make or break is all that we ever heard during earnings season.""
Nvidia was the first to receive praise from Cramer for its record revenue, which soared by 265% due to sustained high demand for its artificial intelligence products. Cramer then lauded Amazon as the “most definitive summa of all,” highlighting its thriving advertising business and expanding web services sector.

What Happened: New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who is a Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull, made note of Apple’s 10 years of “excruciating work” that went down the drain due to the rumored decision to shelve the Apple Car project.
The analyst said he previously viewed that Apple’s unrelated diversification into self-driving cars might be an exception. He suggested he may have been wrong. “Maybe the golden rule of tech applies: being very good at one thing doesn't make you good at any other,” he said.

What Happened: Munster expressed surprise at Apple’s decision to cancel the Apple Car project. He suggested that as a tech company, Apple needs to grow, and acquiring Rivian could be a potential solution.
Speaking to CNBC, Munster said, “Apple’s a tech company, and tech companies by definition need to grow,” noting that Apple hasn’t seen top-line growth in the last six quarters. He proposed that Apple needs to break into big markets to stimulate growth.

Biotech Breakout
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (ARCA: XBI).
Note the following:

The chart shows biotech has broken out.
The chart shows the move up was on high volume, indicating conviction in the move.
The chart shows when XBI was in the Arora buy zone. This represents a 54% gain in about four months. XBI is in the ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio by The Arora Report.
RSI on the chart shows that biotech is overbought.
The breakout in biotech shows there are opportunities for investors beyond AI, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and big tech.
Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) is a prime example. LLY has gained 139% in about a year.
In important news for AI, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has canceled its electric vehicle project.  About 2,000 people have been working on this project. Apple seems to be recognizing that it needs to devote more resources to AI. This is good news for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).

Morgan Stanley analyst and Tesla bull Adam Jonas suggested on Wednesday that Apple Inc‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) lack of a ""monumental dataset"" for training its autonomous car may have been a potential reason for the company dropping the project. Tesla CEO Elon Musk agreed with the hypothesis.
What Happened: Jonas observed that due to high expectations for the company, Apple couldn't have simply produced another car with steering wheels. However, creating an autonomous vehicle, the analyst pointed out, requires extensive testing and data from public roads spanning billions of miles.

Inflation Gauge
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has failed to make progress since the release of hotter CPI.
The chart shows that the stock market was pulling back before the release of PCE, but improved on release of PCE.
The stock market has been anxiously awaiting PCE. PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. PCE rose the most in a year. Here are the details:

Headline PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.4% vs. 0.4% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the stock market improved on the release of the PCE data as there was fear of an even worse number.
Digging into the data that underlies PCE, in The Arora Report analysis, there is deflation in goods, but there is serious inflation in services. Deflation in goods is coming from China.
The release of PCE data has triggered aggressive buying in AI stocks and bitcoin. The buying is especially aggressive in C3.ai Inc (NYSE: AI) after the release of PCE data. C3.ai released better than expected earnings after the close yesterday. As a full disclosure, a signal was given in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Change Alert.
The release of PCE data is also leading to very aggressive buying in small caps. As a full disclosure, iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA: IWM) and its buy zone are in The Arora Report's ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio.
Personal income and spending data was also released this morning. Here are the details:

Personal spending came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.
Personal income came at 1.0% vs. 0.5% consensus.


Weekly initial claims came at 215K vs. 206K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture remains strong, especially at the low end. However, the jobs picture is getting weaker in IT as many jobs are being replaced by AI.

What Happened: Apple has had several eventful months with the release of the iPhone 15 in September and the Vision Pro mixed reality headset in February.
Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) removed Apple from its Conviction List, but notes that the stock remains Buy rated. The price target for Apple was $232 in the latest note from Goldman Sachs after first-quarter earnings.
""There are many reasons a stock could get removed from the list. The can include (but are not limited to), analysts no longer having conviction in their idea, price realization, the passage of catalysts or the subcommittee believing there are better opportunities elsewhere,"" the company said.
Given that Apple retains a Buy rating, it suggests that the analysts’ belief in the stock hasn’t waned. With Apple’s shares experiencing a 5% decline over the past month and a 6% decrease since the beginning of the year, it seems unlikely that the stock’s removal is due to price realization.

2024-03-01T16:22:39Z,AAPL,"Microsoft Corporation‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnership with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) developer OpenAI has become the star celebrity marriage of the technology industry.
It is a union that will allow the company to “further distance itself from the competition” and sustain double-digit revenue and profitability growth for years to come, according to Stifel analyst Brad Reback.
“This is the first time in over two decades Microsoft is not playing from behind in an emerging tech trend,” said Reback.
He added: “We believe its increasing GenAI scale will become a meaningful competitive advantage as the company is able to leverage the virtuous circle generated by its unique Infrastructure & Application usage-based insights to inform its future investment and monetization strategies.”

2024-03-01T18:30:26Z,AAPL,"March kicked off on a high note on Wall Street Friday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices soaring to unprecedented heights, fueled by the unstoppable surge of tech stocks.
Despite the sharper-than-expected contraction revealed by the ISM Manufacturing PMI in February – with the overall index plummeting from 49.5 to 47.8, missing the anticipated 49.1 – investors remained upbeat. The data triggered downward pressure on the dollar and Treasury yields, maintaining firm expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.
Fed speakers – including Goolsbee, Waller and Bostic – offered a mixed bag of remarks, though collectively acknowledging the ongoing progress toward disinflation. Additionally, a Fed report highlighted that inflation expectations broadly align with the 2% target.
In the tech sector, the semiconductor industry continued its remarkable performance, buoyed by escalating demand for chips associated with artificial intelligence. The industry benchmark, as monitored by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), surged 3.7% following a 2.7% leap on Thursday, marking its highest level since inception.

2024-03-01T20:06:29Z,AAPL,"The U.S. tech rally has been nothing short of spectacular over the past year. According to Peter Callahan, a sector specialist at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, it’s not just a fleeting phenomenon but is rooted in sustainable and enduring fundamentals.

The S&P 500 Index is up over 25% in the past year. 
This is evident by the price appreciation seen in ETFs tracking it — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).
At the forefront of this surge are the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. These have played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500’s recent rally.

The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, fell as expected in January, allaying fears of a fresh acceleration.
The Nasdaq 100, as tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), soared past the 18,300 mark to achieve an unprecedented high. The S&P 500, as monitored through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), surged above 5,100 points, also hitting record highs.

The fund has consistently outperformed, landing in the top echelons of its category over the past five years, including a notable finish in the top 14% for 2023, as per Morningstar.
Meyers' diverse investment strategy spans small to large caps. Yet, he currently sees the most potential in small-cap stocks, citing their significant upside compared to their larger counterparts, reported Business Insider.
The backdrop of U.S. stocks reaching all-time highs masks the nuanced reality of the market, Meyers told the publication. While indices like the S&P 500 have surged, the performance of many individual stocks remains lackluster.

What Happened: Niles believes that the earnings potential of these companies will drive their stock performance in 2024, reported CNBC on Sunday. Niles pointed out that the recent surge in stock prices for big tech firms was not due to their earnings but rather the Federal Reserve’s policies.
He anticipates a shift this year, where earnings will play a more significant role in stock market performance. Despite negative estimate revisions for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Niles’ four picks continue to see analysts raise forecasts.
Analysts have raised EPS expectations for the four stocks by an average of 50% since the end of last year. In contrast, estimates have remained nearly flat for Google, Tesla, and Apple. This trend has resulted in substantial stock price increases for Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.

(NASDAQ:META).
He also believes Apple's AI play can move the earnings needle for Cupertino in double-digit percentages.
What Happened: Munster expressed optimism about Apple's AI play, stating that the company's first AI model is expected to be announced sometime in June.
However, investors in 2024 so far have not been very optimistic about Apple's prospects like analysts have.

What Happened: Cramer, the host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” took to X on Tuesday to share his thoughts on Apple’s near-term outlook. He expressed hesitance about the current situation and indicated a need for stock prices to drop significantly before considering a position rebuild.
He wrote, “Club members know our stance on the near-term with Apple. It is not a table pounder. I want stocks to come into well below where they are if we are going to re-build a position.”

The Analyst Takeaways: Sentiment from investors and analysts is approaching a horror show when looking at Apple's story, Ives said.
""The biggest concern around the Apple name is based on negative data points on China smartphone demand that shows very sluggish sales for iPhones in this key region during and leading up to the important Chinese New Year,"" Ives said.
Apple rival Huawei is seeing strong momentum during the ""very challenging period"" for Apple's iPhone demand in the region, Ives added.

2024-03-05T17:02:54Z,AAPL,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fails have been rare since the company introduced the iPhone in 2007, but the recent abandonment of its decade of research and investment in an autonomous car was a black-eye for the company.
Meanwhile, its latest launch, the Vision Pro, a “spatial computing” virtual reality and video headset, has met with mixed reviews and has a $3,499 starting price.
“With a dearth of impactful applications beyond watching movies, Vision Pro clearly needs vastly improved price/performance for bull arguments for disruptive upside opportunity to be credible,” said Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett.
What Apple needs, the analyst added, if it is to maintain its position alongside other Magnificent Seven stocks such as Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), is to step up its artificial intelligence offerings.

2024-03-06T08:50:24Z,AAPL,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer has suggested that the current market activity may indicate a peak rather than a bubble. He pointed to specific stocks and the Nasdaq Composite’s recent decline as evidence.
What Happened: Cramer, during his show Mad Money on Tuesday, analyzed the market’s recent downturn, dismissing it as a bubble but indicating a possible peak, reported CNBC.
“Toppy” action, Cramer explained, is when stock prices exceed their fundamental value, while a bubble is when stocks soar to new highs and then plummet. 
""We start off weak, and then unlike much of the time since the market began to rally in November, we actually then finish even lower. It had been the opposite pattern — some stocks manage to buck the trend, of course, but most can't. That's toppy,"" Cramer said. ""
Bubbly action, on the other hand, is when you go straight up and then straight down, with the only respite being wild short squeezes on the way down.""

Munster Remains Bullish: Deepwater Asset Management’s Managing Partner, Gene Munster, expressed optimism despite the short-term dip. 
“While $AAPL investors are focused on the trees, I believe the forest will prevail,” Deepwater Asset Management’s Managing Partner Gene Munster said in a post on X. “If humanity needs devices in the future, Apple will continue to flourish long-term.”
Case For Apple’s Bullish Potential: In a separate CNBC interview, Munster presented his arguments for a bullish case for Apple. He highlighted Apple’s impressive user base, citing 2.2 billion active devices and a potential 1.4 billion monthly active users (though the latter figure is not officially disclosed by Apple).

2024-03-07T20:20:02Z,AAPL,"We’ve written a lot over the past months — as has every financial media organization — about the meteoric rise of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the artificial intelligence (AI)-linked semiconductor stock.
We’ve asked a lot of questions: Is it overvalued after a 1,634% rise over the past four years? Can the promise of AI deliver the earnings growth expected of the company? Is its position among the mega-cap stocks truly deserved?
The first two questions above will only be answered in hindsight, and the third can only be tackled by comparing Nvidia with a similar-sized company. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for instance.
Apple has the larger market cap — $2.61 trillion. Nvidia is not far behind, sitting on a valuation of $2.29 trillion.

When asked if Apple is late to the AI race, Ives pointed out, “There’s 2.2 billion reasons why they are not too late.”
“This was more of a golden buying opportunity than ultimately the time that Apple becomes a structural negative”

“Nvidia fell to $914 at 4:15 PM ET today after the market closed. But then, by the end of the after hours session at 8:00 PM ET, the stock closed above $946.

A Murky Report
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that in the big picture, the market has not moved much on the Jobs Report.
On a micro level, there was initially selling on the Jobs Report but the dip was aggressively bought running up the market.
The trendline on the chart shows that the stock market is beginning to break away to the upside from the trendline.
The chart shows that the stock market is comfortably above the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows that it is easier for the market to go higher than lower.
Jobs Report, also known as the mother of all reports, is murky giving ammunition to both stock market bulls and bears. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 275K vs 195K consensus. This indicates that the job growth is a lot stronger than expected.
Nonfarm private payrolls came at 223K vs 150K consensus. This indicates that the job growth is strong in the private sector.
Unemployment rate came at 3.9% vs 3.7% consensus. This indicates that while the job growth is strong unemployment is rising.
Average hourly earnings came at 0.1% vs 0.3% consensus.  In The Arora Report analysis, this is the most important data point for investors. This data indicates that hourly wages are rising at the rate of 1.2% annualized. This is much lower than what workers would like but is great for the profits of corporations and also for curbing inflation. This data point is positive for the stock market.
Average work week came at 34.3 vs 34.3 consensus.


The forgoing data is such that the analysts can convincingly make a case for all three of the following depending on personal bias:

No landing
Soft landing
Recession

Negative Nvidia Pattern
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Note the following:

This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of NVDA is being used to illustrate the point. As a full disclosure, NVDA stock is in The Arora Report ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio.
The chart shows that NVDA stock has traced an outside day. An outside day is a reversal pattern in traditional technical analysis.
The chart shows that The Arora Report gave a signal to partially hedge the NVDA position when NVDA was trading at $952.74, right near the very top. Since the signal to hedge NVDA stock, NVDA has lost about $250B worth of value. 
The chart shows that NVDA is long from $125.51 when NVDA stock fell in the Arora buy zone shown on the left side of the chart.
The chart shows that the reversal pattern in NVDA stock was on heavy volume. This is negative.
Nvidia is important for the following reasons.

Nvidia is the center of the artificial intelligence revolution.
Nvidia has been the best performing large cap tech stock.
About one third of S&P 500 performance is due to Nvidia.
Nvidia has become the favorite of the momo crowd, replacing Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Nvidia usually has the most option volume on the call side, indicating the YOLO (you only live once) mentality that has seeped into the stock market.


The move in NVDA stock is actively impacting the entire semiconductor sector. As The Arora Report has written before, semiconductors are the leading sector. As a full disclosure, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) is in The Arora Report ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio.  Readers and members of The Arora Report had an advanced notice that semiconductors may fall from the signal given in ZYX Allocation to take partial profits in semiconductor ETF SMH just prior to the drop. That Arora signal has now proven spot on.
The next major event ahead is CPI data that will be released tomorrow morning at 8:30am ET. The consensus is 0.3% for both the headline and the core. However, whisper numbers are lower ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/03/37592374/nvidia-traces-a-bearish-pattern-hedging-right-at-the-top-central-banks-buy-gold

Hotter Inflation 
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is hovering above the trendline.
The chart shows when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was last reported, the stock market fell as CPI was hotter than expected.
The difference between when CPI was reported last time as shown on the chart and the CPI release this time is that stock market euphoria has significantly expanded.  
The chart shows that the stock market is rising after the CPI report today.
CPI came hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.
Core CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.


On a micro level, the stock market quickly dipped after the release of the hotter than expected CPI, but then the momo crowd stepped in to aggressively buy the dip.
If the stock market was in a rational phase, it would have seen a big drop today on the hotter than expected CPI. However, the stock market is in a euphoric phase. In a euphoric phase, bad news is good news, and good news is great news. A characteristic of the euphoric phase is that all news is bought, irrespective of what it is.  
Momo gurus have a new highly flawed narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The narrative is that year-over-year inflation came at 3.2% vs. 3.1% consensus.
As we have shared with you several times along the way, looking solely at year-over-year is like driving while looking only in the rearview mirror. Investors should look at month-over-month for the last three months – this is like looking through the windshield. Investors should also look at year-over-year, but that is like looking through the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/economics/24/03/37623349/inflation-hotter-than-expected-momo-buys-the-bad-news-jp-morgan-ceo-says-recession-not-off-the-table

QQQ is above the trendline shown on the chart.
The chart shows that QQQ ran up in spite of hotter inflation data. Yesterday, gamma squeeze and AI frenzy completely overpowered inflation data that was negative for the stock market.
Prudent investors know the market cannot ignore inflation forever. While the stock market and the economy are not the same thing, they can not be completely divorced from one another.
As long as QQQ stays above the trendline shown on the chart, the rapidly increasing YOLO (you only live once) behavior in the stock market will continue. In YOLO behavior, investors give up any notion of risk.
The chart shows that if QQQ starts pulling back, the major support zone is far off.
Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL) earnings indicated there is a strong demand for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips.
NVDA stock ran up on Oracle earnings, which pulled up other AI stocks and led the market higher.
Quadruple witching is this Friday. Quadruple witching is to the upside.
The incessant call buying by the momo crowd is leading to a gamma squeeze, putting upward pressure on the stock market. Gamma squeeze is an important market mechanic. Understanding gamma squeeze can give investors an edge.
NVDA has now totally replaced Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as the momo crowd’s favorite stock. The momo crowd is selling TSLA and buying NVDA.
The next major trigger for the stock market will be the Nvidia GTC event that starts on March 18.
The momo crowd is caught up in the AI frenzy to such a large extent that the momo crowd has decided inflation does not matter anymore.

Headline PPI came at 0.6% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus.


PPI feeds directly into PCE, which is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. The data released today shows that the Fed needs to be very careful before cutting rates.

The biggest winner on March 10 was Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which was nominated for 13 awards and took home seven Oscars, including Best Motion Picture of the Year. But the score written for the film, by Swedish-born Ludwig Göransson, helped to leave a lasting impression on viewers long after the credits rolled. For Göransson’s ability to weave intricate compositions, enhancing the audience’s emotional connection to the story, he took home the award for Best Original Score.
Although “Oppenheimer” won the most Oscars of the night, it was undeniable that the spotlight belonged to “Barbie.” For the movie, Billy Eilish and Finneas won best original song for “What Was I Made For,” and their performance at the event made it clear that without these captivating songs in movies, the silver screen would lack the very soul that stirs our emotions and fuels our imaginations.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the index, is up 33.6% over the last year and up 8.3% year-to-date in 2024. The index and ETF have been helped by the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.

What Happened: Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, has been steadfast in his bullish outlook. He recently reiterated his year-end S&P 500 price target of 5,400, a figure he initially proposed a year ago. However, he now considers this estimate to be conservative.
“I think this is a long-term bull market. I got still 5,400 by year-end and that was a pretty bold call a year ago, but right now that’s looking pretty conservative, and why not more?” Yardeni told CNBC on Wednesday. 
With the S&P 500 currently standing at around 5,150, Yardeni’s forecast suggests a potential 26% increase over the next two years. He attributes this optimism to the market’s improving breadth and the possibility of a broader market.

What Happened: On Thursday, Schiff specifically highlighted Tesla and Apple, noting their decline as potential indicators of issues for the remaining five stocks in the group — Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). 
“Tesla, a Magnificent Seven stock is down 46%. That’s not so magnificent for those who bought near the top. Apple, another Mag 7 stock, is down 14%. So if one Mag 7 stock is in a bear market and another is in a correction, that calls into question the prospects for the other five,” he wrote on X.

2024-03-15T18:21:34Z,AAPL,"NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) blazed the trail for artificial intelligence-related stocks, raising some fears of overvaluation and a mounting tech bubble. 
Not so, said analysts at Goldman Sachs this week, as earnings growth expectations warrant current lofty share price gains.
While Nvidia returned 522% since the start of 2022 and 84% year-to-date, Goldman analyst Ryan Hammond said the company’s price/earnings ratio was broadly unchanged since the start of 2023 with nearly all its return attributable to a higher stream of earnings.
For the sector, fears of a bubble could be largely discounted, he said. Three-year earnings growth expectations among the largest 10 tech stocks were around 15%, lower than the 24% seen during the tech bubble of 2000, while valuations were at 28x earnings, much lower than the 52x seen in 2000.

2024-03-15T19:32:22Z,AAPL,"A few months ago, I analyzed the total performance of the three most popular S&P 500 covered call ETFs in 2023: the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (ARCA: JEPI), the GlobalX S&P500 Covered Call ETF (ARCA: XYLD), and the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS: SPYI). 
The covered call ETF that came out on top was the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF for three reasons: they had full exposure to the holdings inside of the S&P 500, wrote out-of-the-money covered calls, and used Section 1256 contracts for enhanced tax-efficiency. 
The total performance of SPYI in 2023 was 18.1%, capturing nearly 69% of the S&P 500 Index's total return last year. Compared to the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF's total return of 9.8%, and the GlobalX S&P 500 Covered Call ETF's total return of 11.0%.
I share these figures because the team that built SPYI — and all of the category leading performance that came with it — has used the same techniques and strategy to build the NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ: QQQI).
What Is QQQI?
The NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF is an ETF that aims to offer high monthly income in a tax-efficient manner and upside potential when the Nasdaq-100 Index (QQQ) rises. 
Let’s break that down simply — as we all know, an ETF is a basket of stocks.
In this case, the basket is constructed to replicate the holdings of the Nasdaq-100 Index. Remember, the Nasdaq-100 Index sits right next to the S&P 500 Index in popularity and portfolio construction. This index tracks the total performance of the 100 largest, most-actively traded stocks listed on the Nasdaq. Think Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)… you get the picture.
The Nasdaq-100 Index delivered +54.9% returns for its investors in 2023, the best year since 1999. Again, this was largely due to the AI craze we saw by companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and others — but incredibly impressive nonetheless.
So, what's the difference between QQQ and QQQI?
A single letter, I.
And that letter stands for income. 
Think about it like this — a 55% return in an investment is awesome. However, to realize that return in your bank account, you’ll need to sell shares of stock. Considering the trailing twelve month dividend yield of the Nasdaq-100 Index is 0.52%, 99.48% of that return was in the form of share price appreciation — not cash dividends paid to you.
But what if there was an ETF that aimed to offer exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index while also optimizing for tax-efficient income for their shareholders?
Enter QQQI. 
The NEOS team has successfully done this with their S&P 500 Index equivalent ETF, SPYI — paying a 12.14% annual distribution yield (as of 3/15/24) to investors while ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/24/03/37758057/qqqi-the-undiscovered-nasdaq-100-covered-call-etf-youve-been-looking-for-14-4-distribution-yield

Early Monday, stock futures showed mostly upward movement, with the tech sector potentially leading the way. Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GTC 2024, featuring CEO Jensen Huang‘s keynote, and the possibility of a partnership between Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are expected to boost sentiment.
However, bond yields are on the rise, reflecting lingering concerns about a hawkish message from the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
Cues From Last Week’s Trading:
Higher-than-expected consumer and producer price inflation data led to the major indices posting their second consecutive weekly losses. Small-cap and tech stocks were particularly affected, with all three major indices closing lower in the week ending March 15. The broader S&P 500 Index reached intra-day and closing highs on Tuesday before retracing following the release of the inflation data.
The week also witnessed a spike in bond yields due to tempered expectations of rate cuts, accompanied by a sharp increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX).
Fund manager Louis Navellier commented on the week’s developments, stating, “The strong rally in equities since the end of October is finally showing some fatigue.” He noted that gains have slowed as expectations for Fed rate cuts are being pushed back, with June now the expected timeframe for the first rate cut, reflecting a 60% probability.

“Stocks pop on AI dreams of a massive upgrade in technology. Google and Nvidia on fire this morning. Apple using Google AI (which still sucks) on iPhones in a sad admission they missed another boat,” Gerber wrote.  
Apple is reportedly in discussions with Google to license Gemini, a set of generative AI models, to power new iPhone software features. This potential deal would build on the existing search partnership between the two tech giants.

2024-03-19T11:00:44Z,AAPL,"Reports of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launching its own AI model and discussing licensing a foundation model with Google and OpenAI illustrate a significant shift in the iPhone maker’s growth strategy, according to Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster in a note on Monday.
Rare Development: Munster notes that after the cancellation of Project Titan, Apple is now considering a rare move for the company – licensing another company’s tech stack.
Pulling the plug on the car project offers Apple two advantages, he said. This decision would free up $4 billion to $5 billion annually, approximately 11% of the company’s overall R&D spend, for artificial general intelligence (AGI), and also allow the company to sharpen its focus on AGI.

2024-03-19T11:41:33Z,AAPL,"Interest-rate concerns seem to be impacting market sentiment as stock futures indicate a slightly lower opening on Tuesday. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, spanning two days, commences on Tuesday, with outcomes expected on Wednesday. Earlier today, the Bank of Japan abandoned its longstanding negative interest rate policy, contributing to market jitters ahead of the Fed’s decision. With no major catalysts driving the market, pre-Fed session nerves may keep sentiment subdued.
Cues From Previous Session:
On Monday, a resurgence in tech stocks, fueled by Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU 2024 developer’s conference and potential partnerships involving Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), bolstered market sentiment.
The major indices opened higher and maintained positive momentum throughout the session, ending the day in positive territory. This reversal snapped a three-session losing streak, although the indices remain below their record highs.
However, small-cap stocks lagged behind, with the Russell 2,000 Index closing lower for the third consecutive session.
Within the S&P sectors, communication services stocks led the gains, while healthcare and real estate sectors experienced modest weakness.

Fed Quandary
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart is a weekly chart to give investors a longer term perspective.
The chart shows that the trendline is still intact.
The momo crowd is going to continue to buy unless there is a sustained breakdown below the trendline for more than one week.
The chart shows two weekly dojis. The doji is a candle pattern where opening and closing prices are very close to each other. A doji pattern indicates indecision. The chart shows two weeks of indecision.
The latest candle shown on the chart is only for a partial week as of this writing. The Fed decision later today will determine how the candle for this week develops.
The two weekly dojis are instructive in that the general belief is that the stock market is running up, but the two dojis on the chart say otherwise.
The FOMC statement will be released at 2pm ET today followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET.
The momo crowd has continued to aggressively buy stocks. The momo gurus want the Fed to bow to them and start cutting rates, or at a minimum clearly indicate that rate cuts are coming soon.
Prudent investors need to understand that the Fed and momo gurus have very different objectives.

The momo gurus’ sole objective is to run up the stock market in the short term in the disguise of analysis.
The Fed has a dual mandate – price stability and maximum employment.
The Fed is concerned about the long term economy of the entire U.S.  Momo gurus are only concerned about the stock market in the short term.  


The Fed faces several problems:

The last two CPI numbers and the last PPI number were hotter than expected. The data shows that inflation is not coming down as the Fed had hoped.
The economy is staying stronger than the Fed had hoped in view of high interest rates.
Financial conditions have become easier in spite of the Fed keeping rates high.
Easier financial conditions make it difficult to control inflation.

AI Memory Sold Out
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU).
Note the following:

This article is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of MU stock is being used to illustrate the point.  As a full disclosure, MU stock is in The Arora Report ZYX Buy Portfolio.
Micron is the largest U.S. semiconductor memory maker.
The chart shows a powerful breakout to the upside after Micron reported earnings.
The most important item from earnings for investors is that high bandwidth memory is sold out for 2024. High bandwidth memory is used in artificial intelligence applications.
In The Arora Report analysis, Micron is likely to ship $600M - $800M worth of high bandwidth memory for AI applications in 2024. As investors understand the need for high bandwidth memory, the PE of MU stock is likely to expand.
The Arora Report is raising the target on MU. 
It is not just AI. The demand for memory is increasing, and prices are increasing.
Here are the important details from Micron earnings that investors should pay attention to:

Q2 EPS came at $0.42 vs. a consensus of a loss of $0.25.
Q2 revenue came at $5.82B vs. $5.34B consensus.
Micron projects Q3 EPS of $0.38 - $0.52 vs. $0.20 consensus.

The Fed turning ultra dovish is an important subject that all investors should deeply understand for their own financial well being. The easiest way to understand is with the analogy of a car. The U.S. government is pushing the accelerator pedal to the floor with reckless spending on the fiscal side. The Fed has been applying the breaks.  Now, the Fed has lifted its foot off of the breaks.

What Happened: Cramer, in a CNBC report published on Thursday, expressed that the DOJ’s legal action against Apple does not weaken the company’s investment appeal. He equated the situation to multiple instances wherein analysts have downgraded Apple’s stock from buy to hold, inadvertently creating further buying opportunities.
The DOJ charged Apple on Thursday with maintaining a “smartphone monopoly” via its iPhone, alleging that the company makes it difficult and expensive for users and developers to leave its ecosystem. The lawsuit implicated Apple’s smartphone and Apple Watch businesses as well as its advertising, browser, FaceTime, and news operations.

On Thursday, CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer and Gene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management weighed in on how the saga might unfold for the company and its stock.
What Happened: The Cupertino tech giant faces antitrust scrutiny for allegedly employing practices that lock customers into iPhones, making it harder to switch brands, and hindering competitors from developing apps that rival Apple’s offerings. 
“I have liked the stock since it was $5,” stated Cramer. He also addressed investor negativity toward Apple stock, noting it’s nothing new. “I have seen so many of these fear waves occur because Apple has some of the least loyal shareholders—but also some of the most,” he added.
“The least loyal are bailing because they never knew the company anyway.”
These remarks come amid the stock underperforming its Magnificent 7 peers. Year-to-date, Apple shares have fallen about 11%, contrasting with record highs for the S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq 100, and Nasdaq Composite.

Earnings news has been mixed, potentially neutralizing its impact on the market. The mood across global markets is also mixed following their recent strong performance.

2024-03-22T17:36:57Z,AAPL,"Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $250.
The Department of Justice brought forth its long-anticipated case against Apple for violating antitrust laws, which has been brewing for years on the back burner since 2019. 
Effectively, a kitchen sink case built up against Apple, although he noted this case would last for years, and ultimately, a settlement in some form likely over the next 12 to 18 months. 
This case escalates the Biden Administration’s antitrust efforts against Big Tech giants and adds to the ongoing antitrust case against Google and other cases against Meta and Amazon.
The analyst does not expect any business model changes for Apple now as this case will likely take years in the courts to prosecute and lead to a conclusion. 
Still, Apple has to find a way to eventually settle this case, pay a hefty fine, and ultimately find some compromise with developers on the App Store structure down the road.
Ives projected second-quarter revenue and EPS of $90.3 billion and $1.54.

SWFs typically take a more conservative investment approach, more like pension funds, as they represent crown wealth rather than simply “other people’s money.” Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) is no different — or wasn’t in the past. 
But things have changed in the past couple of years.
We’ve all witnessed the rise of the mega-cap stock. The Magnificent Seven of technology stocks have ridden the wave of interest in artificial intelligence development to become companies with valuations into the hundreds of billions of dollars — in some cases trillions of dollars.

A decade ago, NBIM was worth $1.08 trillion and took a much more conservative approach to investment.

2024-03-25T17:45:51Z,AAPL,"It’s been a monster year so far for many tech stocks, particularly for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The AI chip maker, on the back of stellar revenues and a rosy outlook, has seen its stock almost double in 2024.
On the flip side, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has seen its stock hammered. The electric vehicle (EV) pioneer, once the largest EV seller in the world, saw that title usurped by its Chinese counterpart, BYD (OTC:BYDDY). This, along with poor earnings call after poor earnings call, has caused the company's stock to plunge more than 30% this year.
These sorts of huge swings present significant opportunities to investors if they are played right. The majority choose to invest directly in a company or indirectly through a broad-based ETF. Both can be smart choices, but investors are locked into a one-to-one relationship with the stock; they don't allow traders a way to further maximize returns or to profit from a stock dipping.
Options have been the primary vehicle for investors to do just that. Unfortunately, trading them is rife with pitfalls and requires a level of sophistication that many investors, if not most, lack.

What Happened: On Monday, Sarat Sethi of Douglas C. Lane & Associates commented on the current market trends. He observed that as the market rallies broadly, the major tech stocks known as the ‘Magnificent 7’ are not participating in the surge. Instead, retail speculators are turning their attention to other areas of the market.
""It's the greater fool theory: who’s going to be the last one holding the bag? These are not fundamental companies. Most of them are not even making money at this point,” Sethi added.
“So the question is when you do get a pullback in the market…these stocks are going to have a huge beta. They are not just going to go down by one or two percent, they could go down in double digits at that point.”

2024-04-01T10:23:20Z,AAPL,"Jim Cramer highlighted the role of share count reduction behind more than half of the S&P 500 stocks achieving new 52-week highs in the first quarter.
What Happened: Cramer mentioned that a considerable number of companies have substantially cut their share count since 2019, an approach that has mostly flown under the radar, as reported by CNBC on Monday. This trend of share count reduction spans multiple sectors, including housing, retail, and technology.
“Check the share count before you buy a stock. You want a management that agrees with you, not one that thinks it can give away stock as compensation, often to throw you off the scent of adulterated earnings power,” he said.
Cramer cited examples of companies such as Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) in the housing sector that have significantly reduced their share count. For example, Lennar’s outstanding shares have decreased to 276 million from 318 million five years ago, while Toll Brothers’ shares have dropped to 105 million from 145 million.

2024-04-01T13:50:19Z,AAPL,"Among the so-called Magnificent Seven technology companies, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) have emerged as standout performers, albeit in contrasting directions. 
What Happened: Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla suffered double-digit declines in the first three months of the year, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
The other Mag7 stocks include Nvidia, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).
Among these companies, Nvidia’s stock has soared the highest, spiking 85% over the first quarter this year. Tesla’s stock, meanwhile, has struggled to maintain momentum, marking a notable shift in market dynamics. It’s down 20%.

Chart: Benzinga Pro
Nvidia, known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, saw its stock rise by 245% in 2023. Shares continued their ascent in 2024. Nvidia’s stock is up about 85% YTD.

What Happened: The S&P 500 has delivered its strongest first quarter since 2019, despite an 11% drop in Apple’s shares and a nearly 30% fall in Tesla’s stock. A report from The Wall Street Journal highlights the emergence of a new tech quartet, consisting of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has been pivotal in driving the broader market’s performance.
Investor sentiment is buoyed by hopes that the economy may skirt a severe recession and anticipations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The burgeoning excitement around artificial intelligence technologies has also played a role in bolstering market optimism.
""The fact that the market is still holding these levels and trading up without that full force of the Magnificent Seven is actually a really positive thing,"" said Joseph Ferrara, investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers.

What Happened: An analyst at Loop Capital, Ananda Baruah, has revised his estimates for Apple’s earnings, foreseeing a potential drop in the company’s overall revenue and EPS for the first time since 2016, reported Barron's.
Baruah’s projections for the March and June quarters suggest that Apple’s earnings might not meet Wall Street’s expectations. He reduced his target price for the Apple stock to $170 from $180, with a “Hold” rating.
Baruah attributes the potential decline in earnings to sluggish iPhone sales, particularly in China, where sales have plummeted by 30% year-over-year. This is despite a 7% overall decrease in smartphone sales in China during the same period.

It is time to increase cash by 4%. Hedges were recently raised. Please see the protection band section below.

Hotter Inflation 
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has broken the upward sloping trendline that has defined the rally.
The chart shows the Arora call to raise hedges prior to the drop.
The chart shows the support zone from which the breakout occurred. The tentative plan is to buy if the stock market pulls back to the support zone. However, this will need to be adjusted – read the next point.
The probability of the stock market pulling back to the support zone is less than 50%. The reason is that the buy the dip crowd is already aggressively buying the dip and is prepared to aggressively buy more.  
The new data shows that inflation is hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.

2024-04-12T14:04:04Z,AAPL,"Two of America's biggest companies, which have made ""massive"" bets on China, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), cannot abandon the country just because they're undergoing a ""white-knuckle"" period, says top analyst Dan Ives.
What Happened: Tesla and Apple are both currently experiencing the impact of an economic slowdown in China and growing competition from local players like Warren Buffett-backed BYD Company Ltd. and Huawei Technologies.
""China is the heart and lungs of Tesla's growth story. That's 35% to 40% demand that's [coming] from China,"" Ives said in an interview with Hankyung Global Market.
While Tesla has seen a sliver of hope when it comes to sales of its vehicles made in China, Apple's sales in the country fell 33% year-on-year in February.

Oil is most sensitive to developments in the Middle East.
The chart shows that oil is falling after an Iranian attack on Israel.
The chart shows that oil is consolidating around the upper trendline.
The best of all scenarios is playing out in the Middle East.

Although there are contradictory reports, it is near certain that Iran informed Turkey and Turkey informed the U.S. of the Iranian attack in advance.
The reason Iran informed the U.S. in advance is because Iran’s purpose was to show force and save face but not inflict much damage and for the U.S. to restrain Israel.
The advance notice allowed the U.S. and Israel to shoot down 99% of about 300 drones and missiles, resulting in very little damage.
Iran issued several statements that the operation was concluded.
Biden is working hard to restrain Israel.
Not only is oil down, stocks are being aggressively bought on the best Middle East scenario being played out.


In The Arora Report analysis, Iran’s response to directly attack Israel has increased risks in the long term, especially without a robust response from Israel.
Further, in The Arora Report analysis, Iran is buying time to build its nuclear capability.
The momo crowd, being in a celebratory mood, is oblivious to several negative developments as outlined below:

A market research firm with a good track record is projecting that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone shipments fell about 10% in the last quarter. Apple shipped 50.1M iPhones according to this report. The consensus from Wall Street analysts is 51.7M iPhones. This is the worst drop in Apple iPhone shipments since the COVID lockdown.

Extraordinary Move In Treasuries
Please click here for an enlarged chart of 20+ year Treasury bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).

The chart shows that TLT has fallen below the support/resistance zone. This prior support zone has now become a resistance zone.
The chart shows that after a breakdown below the zone, Treasuries have continued to fall.
The chart shows a downward sloping trendline and a significant move lower away from the trendline.
The chart shows that the down move is on heavy volume. This indicates conviction.
Historically, at a time of geopolitical tension, money rushes into U.S. Treasuries, and U.S. Treasuries rocket up. Based on history, on Iran attacking Israel, U.S. Treasuries should have moved up. But as the chart shows, Treasuries have continued to move down.
In The Arora Report analysis, Treasuries moving down in spite of the Iranian attack on Israel is quite extraordinary. 
Prudent investors pay attention when something extraordinary happens in the markets.  
Lower Treasuries mean lower stock valuations. All investors should fully grasp this point.  
As is their pattern, the momo crowd is oblivious to this extraordinary development and is buying stocks. The momo crowd’s buy the dip without analysis mentality is on full display.
Fed Chair Powell has been itching to cut interest rates. Clearly, the bond market is not only defying him, but it is telling him he is wrong. Powell will be participating in a Q&A. We will be paying close attention to what he says.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly is saying there is no urgency to cut rates.
Wall Street seems to be coming around. A major bank is accepting the real risk of a rate hike. Of course, members and readers of The Arora Report, already knew in advance that the data could force the Fed’s hand to raise rates at a time when everyone expects rate cuts.
Lower Treasury bonds mean higher yields in the U.S. Higher yields mean a higher dollar.

Some individuals are even barred from purchasing expensive insurance policies or going on vacation, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has pulled back after breaking below the trendline.  
The chart shows the support zone.  
The chart shows that in spite of the pullback, the stock market is still about 5% above the support zone.  
Powell had repeatedly made it clear that he was itching to cut interest rates. This is what initially triggered the stock market rally in 2023 and kept the stock market rally going in 2024.  
When inflation data from January came hotter than expected, the hot inflation data went against Powell, but Powell dismissed it as a one-off. The hot inflation data for February again went against Powell, but Powell again dismissed it as a one-off.
The chart shows when CPI data was reported for January, February, and March.   
When the March inflation data came against Powell, prudent investors were eagerly awaiting how Powell would justify rate cuts after data went against him three months in a row. Powell has now shifted, saying that it will take longer to be confident about inflation. Powell acknowledged that progress on inflation has stalled. Powell now expects to hold interest rates at the current level longer than he previously expected.  
In the stock market, there was a short dip on Powell’s statement. The momo crowd aggressively bought the dip. This morning, the momo crowd continues to aggressively buy stocks.  
Due to the importance of Powell’s switch and the consequences of Powell’s error over the last several months to investors.
As the day and the week progresses, prudent investors need to stay alert to how the market reacts to earnings. Earnings season is in full swing. So far, earnings are mixed. Prudent investors should also stay in tune with what smart money does. As a reminder, when the momo crowd aggressively bought stocks after Iran attacked Israel, smart money took advantage of the strength generated by the momo crowd to trim stocks.

2024-04-19T10:48:22Z,AAPL,"U.S. stocks appear headed for another losing day, potentially marking a sixth consecutive session in the red for Wall Street. While index futures on Friday clawed back some earlier losses, sentiment remains fragile following Israel’s missile strikes on Iran in response to drone attacks and as explosions were reported in Syria and Iraq.
Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), the first major tech company to report earnings, disappointed investors with comments about ending membership guidance. Investors may also turn their attention to upcoming regional bank earnings reports. With commodities retreating from their initial spikes and bond yields falling, a potential reversal in sentiment remains in play despite the extended decline.
The session will also likely see volatility as options contracts tied to about $3 trillion in stocks, equity indexes, and exchange-traded funds expire on Friday.

2024-04-20T16:00:15Z,AAPL,"The extended sell-off seen in the market since April 12 has been led by high-profile tech stocks, which ironically were the leaders of the rally that began in 2023.
The Tech Rout: The broader market, which rallied through 2023, carried over the momentum into the new year and the upward trend continued until March. In April, rate-cut bets began to unravel as inflation stalled its downtrend. Federal Reserve officials, who hinted at up to three Fed funds rate cuts following the March monetary policy meeting, began to sing a different tune. 
Bond yields began to spike higher in reaction, with the 10-year note yield jumping to a high of 4.696% this week before slightly easing off the level.
All these factors exerted downward pressure on tech stocks, which fall under the category of growth stocks. A higher interest-rate environment is seen as detrimental to these stocks because it diminishes their long-term discounted cash flow and makes it harder for them to secure low-cost debt financing.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has pulled back to its lowest level since Jan. 31, dragged by six consecutive sessions of losses. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which comprised the biggest non-financial tech stocks, ended at its lowest since Jan. 16.

What Happened: The Cupertino-based tech giant has revised its Vision Pro shipment estimates to 400,000-450,000 units for 2024, down from the initial 700,000-800,000 units. The changes have forced Apple to reconsider its overall headset strategy, said analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
He suggests that the demand for Vision Pro has dropped significantly in the United States, leading Apple to adopt a cautious approach to its international launch. This has prompted Apple to re-evaluate its headset business strategy.

2024-04-25T15:35:13Z,AAPL,"In a tumultuous day for tech stocks, the collective market value of the Magnificent 7 tech giants plummeted by over $300 billion in the first trading hour on Thursday, primarily fueled by a weaker-than-expected revenue outlook from Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and concerning economic indicators arising from the first-quarter gross domestic product release.
What Happened: Meta Platforms outperformed Wall Street's expectations with first-quarter revenue of $36.45 billion, a 27% increase year-over-year, and earnings per share of $4.71, beating the predicted $4.32. Investors pulled back after the social media giant issued subdued guidance for the upcoming quarter. 
The company’s forecast for the second quarter anticipates revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, putting the lower end of the range below the consensus estimate of $38.3 billion. 
Additionally, the social media giant anticipates increases in infrastructure and legal costs — pushing full-year expenses to between $96 billion and $99 billion. 
Compounding the tech sector’s woes were the latest GDP figures released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

2024-04-25T18:25:01Z,AAPL,"Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) reported its first-quarter 2024 earnings, revealing a revenue of $36.45 billion, which surpassed analyst estimates.
Despite this positive revenue performance, Meta Platforms’ shares declined by 15% in after-market trading due to lower-than-expected revenue in the first quarter and a slightly disappointing outlook for the second quarter, coupled with increased expenses and capital expenditure forecasts for 2024.
Read: Meta Platforms Stock Is Tumbling Thursday: What’s Going On?
Meta expects operating losses for its Reality Labs division to significantly rise year-over-year. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and CEO, expressed optimism, citing progress in AI development and metaverse building efforts.
Here’s what analysts have said about the earnings report.
JPMorgan On Meta
Analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated his Overweight rating on Meta while reducing the price target from $535 to $480 a share.
“Meta is more optimistic & ambitious on AI than ever, and believes it can become the leading AI company in the world,” said Anmuth.
To this end, Meta’s management anticipates challenges in the coming months, including tough comparisons from 2023 regarding China advertiser spending, Reels monetization and engagement trends. Despite these challenges, Meta remains optimistic about its AI initiatives, believing they will yield significant long-term benefits. 
“We are encouraged that Meta's success w/Llama 3 and Meta AI has increased management's confidence in leading in AI,” he noted.
The company’s strong competitive position, focus on user experience and strategic alignment with AI and the metaverse suggest a promising future, per Anmuth. 
Despite the increased spending, analysts project double-digit revenue and EPS growth for Meta in 2025 and 2026, given its history of driving returns on investment.
Wedbush On Meta
Analyst Scott Devitt had an Outperform rating on Meta. Devitt too, reduced his price target on the stock from $570 to $480 a share.
Meta is “in the early stages of a multi-year investment cycle to support metaverse and AI initiatives that willlikely take several years to scale adoption and monetization,” said Devitt.
Wedbush has adjusted its profit forecasts to account for Meta’s accelerated expense growth and increased capital expenditure in the coming years. For the near term, Devitt thinks “the setup will be challenging” and sees limited upside.
On a relative basis, Wedbush favors Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google (Outperform, Best Idea), within the group.
Needham On Meta
Analyst Laura Martin had an Underperform rating on Meta and no price target. Her recommendation: “use Meta as a source of funds,” implying investors should sell the stock as opposed to buying it.
Martin is skeptical about buying Meta stock for several reasons. 

Meta’s management suggests it is in a two- to three-year investment cycle before revenue growth materializes, which raises concerns about the stock’s potential.

What Happened: On Friday, Cramer took to X, formerly Twitter, to express his observation. He noted the abundance of articles discussing Apple’s recent struggles with antitrust regulations and its latest product, Vision Pro, while Google and Microsoft’s remarkable quarterly results barely made the news.
His post came after Alphabet and Microsoft released their earnings reports, both of which exceeded analyst expectations, while Apple’s iPhone sales in China plunged.

Fed’s Favorite Inflation Gauge

The chart shows that the stock market is consolidating between the resistance zone and support zone.

This morning, the stock market dodged a big bullet. The bullet was the fear that PCE, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, would come higher than the consensus. The data came inline with the consensus. Here are the details:

Headline PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.


The PCE data just released has proven that The Arora Report call has been spot on. The Arora Report call has been that inflation is coming from services and is sticky. Digging below the headline, the just released data shows that inflation is coming from services and is sticky.
Momo gurus have been forecasting that inflation would have gone down to 2% by now. If you annualize 0.3%, it translates to 3.6%. The momo gurus are wrong again. Even though momo gurus are almost always wrong, prudent investors should not ignore them. The reason is that the media promotes momo gurus because they boost ratings. Momo gurus have legions of followers who do not do any analysis and just follow the momo gurus like sheep.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. Therefore, prudent investors pay attention to personal income and personal spending. Consumers continue to excessively spend. This is helping the economy and ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/04/38461403/stock-market-dodges-a-bullet-momo-gurus-proven-wrong

Cues From Previous Session:
Despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell treading a dovish line, the major averages closed mixed on Wednesday. Stocks mostly languished sideways until the afternoon, characteristic of a Fed decision day. They began to rise after the pause verdict was announced and the upward momentum accelerated after Powell’s press conference.
The Fed chief made it clear that the Fed would likely ease rather than tighten further and also conceded that the monetary policy is restrictive. Sentiment reversed course in the last thirty minutes of trading and the averages reversed course before closing mixed.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell for a second straight session, returning to their lowest closing level since April 22. The Dow Industrials ended higher, thanks to strong gains in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Wage Growth Slows
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market may attempt to break out of consolidation and run towards the resistance zone. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is set to run up.
There is aggressive buying in stocks, bonds, gold, silver, and bitcoin on the jobs report. Investors are celebrating slower wage growth and lower than expected job creation. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 175K vs. 250K consensus.
Private non-farm payrolls came at 167K vs. 175K consensus.
Average hourly earnings came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus. On an annualized basis, this wage growth is 2.4%. This is good news on the inflation front.


With Powell itching to cut rates, this report is going to give Powell the ammunition he needs.
The stock market always has crosscurrents. One of the negatives from this jobs report is that with slowing jobs growth and slowing wage growth, the consumer may stop spending excessively. The U.S. economy has stayed out of recession because of excessive consumer spending. If the consumer stops spending excessively, earnings growth will be lower than the current Wall Street consensus. In turn, it will hit the stock market negatively.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings were roughly inline with the consensus but worse than whisper numbers. Here are the two most important pieces of data:

Q2 iPhone revenue was $45.96B vs. $51.3B last year.
China sales are down 8%.

What Happened: In the latest installment of his weekly “Power On” newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman suggested that Apple should prioritize making the iPad a true laptop replacement. He argued that Apple has been taking half-measures in this direction and needs to make a firm commitment.
“From a business standpoint, there's always been a fear that the iPad will cannibalize Mac sales if it gets too powerful. So what? Neither category is doing that hot right now,” Gurman said, adding, “Apple should just make the best iPad it can, while also making the best Mac it can. The days of purposely holding back the iPad need to end.”

2024-05-06T11:09:27Z,AAPL,"U.S. stocks are likely to extend their gains as major index futures are modestly higher on Monday. Strong earnings reports continue to support the market, with S&P 500 earnings expected to grow by 5% year-over-year — the highest rate since Q2 2022. The possibility of rate cuts has re-emerged, making this week’s flurry of Fed speeches potentially market-moving events. Analysts are confident the upward momentum will continue after a slow April, with the typical strength seen in election years (over the next three months) likely aiding the rally.

In premarket trading on Monday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) climbed 0.31% to $512.87, and the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) jumped 0.27% to $436.65, according to Benzinga Pro data.
Cues From Previous Session 
A dovish Federal Reserve message, benign economic data, and positive earnings reports fueled the market rally for a second consecutive week. All three major indices closed the week ending May 3 firmly in positive territory. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn’t provide a specific timeline for rate cuts, he reassured investors by clarifying that hikes are not on the immediate horizon. Big tech companies like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) met analyst expectations with their earnings reports.
The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector reading fell sharply and dipped into contraction territory. However, the monthly non-farm payrolls report offered mixed signals: lower-than-expected job growth in April, a slight increase in the unemployment rate, and slower-than-expected wage growth.

2024-05-06T16:15:49Z,AAPL,"By Lance Roberts
The latest FOMC meeting caused a stock rally as Jerome Powell turned more “dovish” than expected. While Powell did note that progress on inflation has been lackluster, the announcement of the reversal of “Quantitative Tightening” (QT) excited the bulls.
Beginning in June, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities at $35 billion and will reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into Treasury securities”

Of course, the reversal of QT means a buyer of Treasury bonds is returning to the market, increasing overall market liquidity. It also means the Treasury will issue $105 billion less in gross in Q3. The bond market also got the memo, as the Fed’s return to the bond market suggests lower yields in the months ahead, easing financing pressure in the economy.
We have previously discussed the following chart of “liquidity,” which subtracts the Treasury General Account and Reverse Repo from the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. The recent market decline coincided with a sharp drop in liquidity as the TGA account surged to almost $1 trillion from April tax receipts. Over the next few months, that liquidity in the TGA will get released into the economy. At the same time, the Federal Reserve will reduce its balance sheet runoff, which will further add to overall liquidity.

Notably, the market has weathered the reduction in liquidity to date. While higher rates and the reversal of “Quantitative Easing” led to a 20% market decline in 2022, investors began to “front run” the Fed in anticipation of rate cuts and a return to balance sheet expansion.

Given that “QE” programs increase bank reserves by crediting their reserve accounts for bonds bought, the introduction of the tapering of “QT” is the first step in increasing system liquidity.",https://www.benzinga.com/economics/24/05/38648259/stock-rally-as-powell-sparks-a-buying-frenzy

2024-05-08T11:11:07Z,AAPL,"Prominent tech analyst Gene Munster has observed a ""surprise takeaway"" from Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad launch event on Tuesday where the company unveiled the M4 chip.
What Happened: Munster took to X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday to express his thoughts on the significance of the M4 chip announcement.
He believes that this development indicates Apple’s growing speed in updating its silicon and its focus on making hardware a competitive advantage in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
“I have a surprise takeaway from the $AAPL iPad event. Apple is getting a lot faster at updating its silicon with the announcement of the M4 chip.""

Apple first announced the first M-series branded chip in 2020, powering Macs. A year later, it announced the first iPad with an M-series chip, the 2021 iPad Pro.
It took Apple 19 months to launch the M2 chip, and since then, the time gap has continued to fall.

These introductions mark the first update to the iPad lineup since October 2022, signaling a significant step in Apple’s product evolution, and are expected to improve the revenue mix and drive growth going forward, according to Goldman Sachs.
Key Insights from the New iPad Launch
Goldman Sachs equity analyst Michael Ng highlighted several critical aspects of the new iPad releases that investors should note:

Support for Revenue Growth: “The introduction of the new iPad models aligns with Apple’s forecast for F3Q24E, which anticipates double-digit year-over-year growth in iPad revenue,” Ng stated. This growth is supported by clean iPad channel inventory, thanks to strategic efforts to clear out older models before the new releases. This move is particularly expected to bolster revenue trends in Greater China.
Advancements in AI and Processing Power: The new iPad Pro features Apple's latest M4 chip, which is described as “more powerful than any AI PC NPU today.” The M4 chip's Neural Engine can process up to 38 trillion operations per second, outpacing any current AI PC neural processing unit.

Buying On Rising Layoffs
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has vigorously risen from the recent pullback.
The chart shows that RSI reached oversold levels during the recent pullback and now has risen to touch the lower band of the overbought zone.  Historically, this setup leads to more stock market gains.
The chart shows that the volume during the recent rise is not heavy.  This indicates lack of conviction.
The chart shows that the stock market is now in the resistance zone.
In The Arora Report analysis, stops of the short sellers are right above the resistance zone.  If the stock market rises further, Wall Street’s hunt and destroy algorithms will kick in, taking out the stops of short sellers and igniting a short squeeze. The result of such a scenario would be a new stock market high.  
Yesterday in the Morning Capsule we shared with you:

Jobless claims came at 231K vs. 213K consensus. This indicates that the job market is beginning to slow.


The bulls latched on to the rise in jobless claims and aggressively bought stocks. There is merit to this line of thinking because Powell is already itching to cut rates and rising layoffs will give him an excuse to cut rates.
Prudent investors need to be somewhat careful as weekly jobless claims series is very volatile.
For proper analysis at The Arora Report, in addition to the weekly data, we look at a four week moving average of initial jobless claims.  The four week moving average is now at 215K – up 2.26% from the prior week and down 10.14% from a year ago.  Considering the size of the U.S. economy, a rise of 2.26% over the prior week is hardly meaningful, but do not tell that to trigger happy stock market bulls.  Prudent investors should watch the trend over a period of several weeks, not just one week. Jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in The Arora Report adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/05/38764633/aggressive-stock-buying-on-rising-layoffs-and-revenue-rise-at-the-largest-chip-manufacturer-tsmc

The struggling video game retailer saw its shares soar from under $20 to nearly $500 at their peak in January 2021, largely driven by a short squeeze on investors who had bet against the stock amid weak fundamentals. 
Unlike traditional stocks, which are influenced by fundamental analysis and corporate performance, meme stocks are often subject to rapid price changes driven by hype and mass trading actions.
Gill chronicled his investment journey across various platforms, including YouTube and Reddit, notably under the username u/DeepF******Value on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets. His philosophy is emblematic of a broader narrative about meme stocks and the democratization of investing, illustrating how individual investors can unite to disrupt the financial status quo of seasoned and ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38804015/as-roaring-kitty-returns-here-are-3-etfs-to-leverage-the-2024-meme-stock-wave

2024-05-14T03:33:42Z,AAPL,"Gene Munster, a prominent tech analyst, at Deepwater Asset Management has predicted that OpenAI could pose a significant challenge to Alphabet Inc‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) Google in the search business, despite its ties with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Munster’s forecast comes on the heels of Apple Inc‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) potential partnership with OpenAI.
What Happened: Munster, took to social media platform X, to express his views on OpenAI’s potential to disrupt the search business. He acknowledged that OpenAI had not yet announced a search product, but he remained convinced that OpenAI would eventually become a formidable competitor in the search market.
He also noted that OpenAI’s 49% ownership by Microsoft could complicate its path into the search business. Despite this, Munster expects OpenAI to make significant announcements by the end of the year.
“I still believe it's a function of time before OpenAI gets more aggressive with search,” Munster wrote.

Hotter Inflation Data

Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market is in the resistance zone.
As is their pattern, the momo crowd was buying ahead of the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) on hope strategy.
The momo crowd’s hopes were dashed when PPI data came much hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at 0.5% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.5% vs. 0.2% consensus.


The chart shows the stock market first dipped on bad inflation data, but as of this writing in the premarket, the momo crowd is aggressively buying the dip.
Prudent investors, in The Arora Report analysis, would want to wait to see Consumer Price Index (CPI) data tomorrow before taking any action. CPI will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.
The Arora Report previously shared that the Fed’s second blunder has loosened financial conditions way beyond where they should be based on the economic data.
The Fed’s blunder is now showing up in meme stocks roaring back. Earlier this morning, GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) was up 163% in the premarket on top of 74% gain yesterday.
The meme crowd ran up AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) 156% this morning, trading as high as $13.30 in the premarket. AMC took advantage of the meme crowd to raise about $250M of new capital by selling shares at $3.45. When the company is selling shares at $3.45, why would the meme crowd buy the same shares at $13.30?  The answer is the meme crowd is not doing any analysis other than becoming a meme to cause a short squeeze.
The last meme craze ended in tears for the meme crowd with big losses. As full disclosure, The Arora Report gave a number of successful, short term signals on meme stocks, taking advantage of previous crazes. If the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/penny-stocks/24/05/38821745/new-hotter-inflation-data-momo-buys-the-dip-fed-blunder-shows-up-in-roaring-meme-stocks

A recent demonstration by OpenAI, showcasing the power of virtual assistants and multi-modal AI on smartphones, has sparked excitement among investors.

Cooler Inflation Data
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is breaking out above the resistance zone.
The chart shows a highly unusual occurrence – RSI is at 100. This is the most extreme overbought level. The extreme overbought level indicates that either the stock market is ready for another strong up leg, or the breakout is going to fail.
Sentiment is extremely positive. At extremes, sentiment is a contrary indicator. In plain English, extreme positive sentiment is a sell signal. However, it is important to remember that sentiment is not a precise timing indicator.
In The Arora report analysis, based on the other macro and fundamental data, there is about a 40% probability that the breakout will fail even though technicals are very strong.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) came slightly cooler than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.


As most investors are elated over the CPI number, prudent investors need to remember that on an annualized basis, core CPI is still 3.6%. The Fed’s target is 2%. Further, prudent investors need to remember that goods inflation is coming down due to over production in China, but services inflation is still sticky.   
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. For this reason, prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. Here is the latest retail sales data.

Headline retail sales came at 0.0% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Retail sales ex-auto came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.


Retail sales data shows that the consumer is finally pulling back. This will negatively impact earnings. In the long run, the single best determinant of the stock market is earnings. However, at least for today, elated investors are not thinking far ahead about earnings.

The analyst said Google I/O contextualized how Alphabet will integrate and monetize over twenty years of AI initiatives and pursue the first big search transformation in as many years with Project Astra. 
Pitz noted, specifically, the monetization of AI Overview improving ROAS, the cost to serve declining 80%, and Gemini integrating at the OS level across smartphones.
Bears likely argued that recent OpenAI multimodal Agent demos are more advanced, but he argued that GOOGL leverages significant scale advantages and ecosystem integration over time.

Bracelin reiterated an Overweight rating on Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) with a price target of $240.
From his standpoint, the industry takeaways were that Iceberg adoption is still nascent, less than 200 attendees per session suggests Iceberg is still in the hands of early adopters, and broader enterprise adoption of Iceberg across the Global 2000 could still be much further out, with most use cases in the hands of the biggest open-source users and advocates.

What Happened: ETF company Roundhill Investments was the first to market with several thematic investment vehicles including a sports betting ETF, launched in 2020.
In December 2021, Roundhill launched a meme stock ETF aimed at capturing interest in meme stocks, which grew in popularity during the early months of the year.

Beat In The Cards:  The big debate between bears and bulls, coming into 2024 was around monetization of the AI revolution, said Ives in a note. Investors were seeking proof for enterprise spending ramping up to justify the valuations of AI-levered stocks, he said.
Big techs such as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others confirmed over the last few weeks that “AI monetization is now well underway hitting the shores of the tech sector,” he said, adding that this completed the first part of the puzzle.
Ives also noted that there have been eye-popping and impressive developer conferences from OpenAI, Google and Microsoft over the last week and Apple, Inc.

This week marks a significant change, as the settlement cycle transitions from T+2 to T+1. The Securities and Exchange Commission expects this shift to reduce risks associated with unsettled trades, including credit, market, and liquidity risks.
Traders are carefully weighing each piece of economic data as they reassess the likelihood of future interest rate cuts. Speeches from Federal Reserve officials and an upcoming consumer confidence report are key factors influencing their decisions.
While the premarket shows strength in the big tech sector, suggesting potential gains on Tuesday, investors may remain cautious leading up to the inflation data release on Friday.

Buying On Bad News
Please click here for an enlarged chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The chart shows that bonds have rapidly moved up after consolidating in the mini support zone.
The chart shows that bonds are now in the resistance zone.
Higher bonds mean lower yields.  For the time being, investors are buying stocks on lower yields. Yields have rapidly dropped on softer economic data.

JOLTS report came at 8.059M vs. 8.34M consensus.
Factory orders came at 0.7% vs. 0.6% consensus.
Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ: ADP) is the largest payroll processor in the country and uses its data to give an advanced glimpse of the jobs picture ahead of the official jobs report. ADP payrolls came at 152K vs. 175K consensus.


Initial jobless claims will be released Thursday at 8:30am ET providing more data.
Looking ahead, the most important data is the jobs report, known as the mother of all reports, that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET.
The momo crowd always believes that bad news is good news and good news is great news.  However, prudent investors need to remember that the momo crowd is only one group in the stock market. In contrast to the momo crowd, smart money looks ahead knowing that “bad news is good news” works only as long as earnings hold up.  Historically, when economic data starts showing weakness, earnings get hit, leading to a drop in the stock market.  
History shows that somewhere along the way, a transition happens from “bad news is good news” to “bad news is bad news.” Stay tuned to The Arora Report – we will share with you when the transition starts occurring. In the meanwhile, consider continuing to follow the protection band which is bullishly positioned relative to its benchmark.

Strong Jobs Report
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Cross currents in the stock market are increasing. Investors may need to handle increasing volatility due to cross currents. The best way to handle increasing volatility is to follow the protection band.
Hedges are being raised. 
The chart shows that after hitting the low band of the support zone, the stock market made a new high. This is technically a bullish pattern.
The chart shows yesterday was the lowest volume day in a long time. This indicates a lack of conviction. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market can go either way.
The chart shows that the stock market is selling off in the early trade on a stronger than expected jobs report.
Here are the details of the jobs report:

Nonfarm payrolls came at 272K vs. 186K consensus.
Nonfarm private payrolls came at 229K vs. 168K consensus.
Average hourly earnings came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus.
Average work week came at 34.3 hours vs. 34.3 hours consensus.
Unemployment rate came at 4.0% vs. 3.9% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report, when taken in totality along with the recent weak data from JOLTS and jobless claims, precludes the Fed from cutting rates at this time if the Fed is truly data dependent.  
Momo gurus have been persuading their followers to buy stocks ahead of the jobs report because they claimed they knew the jobs report would be very weak.  Momo gurus are wrong again.  However, momo gurus have some ammunition for a new narrative to persuade their followers to continue to buy stocks. In The Arora Report analysis, here is the ammunition momo gurus can use:

The unemployment rate rose.
Household survey data was weaker.

Needham on Apple: The WWDC Keynote was disappointing, according to Martin.
""There was nothing we heard during the WWDC keynote that makes us believe that consumers will buy iPhones faster than our current projections,"" Martin said.
The analyst said GenAI was the best hope for Apple's event, ""but fizzled."" Martin also questioned why Apple waited to talk about GenAI until the end of the event, ""which made them appear tone-deaf to Wall Street's concerns.""
""Annual product launches are too slow a pace in a GenAI world.""
Martin said the biggest surprise from the event was the fact that Apple will outsource a part of the consumer offering to OpenAI.

The Shift to AI: The report said consumers’ adoption of AI will be much faster than their adoption of previous technologies, such as the smartphone and the personal computer.
“Our research suggests that AI-enabled consumer hardware — defined as hardware with integrated AI agents — could penetrate 50% of the U.S. internet user base in fewer than four years, and nearly 75% penetration by the end of 2030, up from near-zero in 2022,” the report said.
The report saw AI as a significant time saver for consumers, who can heed AI product recommendations instead of doing the research themselves. 
ARK Invest cited a study that showed consumers spend on average 15 hours researching cars before making a purchase, time which could be saved dramatically by AI. Its research suggested that AI could facilitate $9 trillion in global private consumption by 2030.
“While brand recognition and loyalty currently play meaningful roles in consumer purchases, especially of non-discretionary goods and services, brand leverage is likely to shift from consumer-facing applications and marketplaces to trusted AI agents,” the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/06/39277447/ai-will-save-time-revolutionize-advertising-says-cathie-woods-ark-invest-report

The chart shows the volume has been low, indicating lack of conviction. In theory, the volume today should be significantly higher. The Arora Report will be carefully watching the volume.
RSI on the chart shows the market is overbought, making it susceptible to a pullback.

Headline CPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.1% consensus. This is the lowest since 2020.
Core CPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the probability of a rate cut in September is now 55%, and the probability of a rate cut in December is 90%.    
The Fed’s rate decision will be announced at 2pm ET, followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET.
At The Arora Report, we will be carefully watching the dot plot. The dot plot indicates interest rate projections of FOMC members.

Inflation in China is also falling both at the producer level and the consumer level. Since the U.S. is a major importer of Chinese goods, lower producer level inflation in China also helps lower inflation in the U.S. Here are the details:

RPO growth accelerated from the previous quarter's 29% to 44% year-on-year to $98 billion, ""driven by robust new AI contract signings,"" the analyst stated, while adding that the company's cRPO growth remained at 15% for the second consecutive quarter. ""Non-GAAP operating margin improved q/q to 46.7% from 43.6%,"" he further wrote.
Stifel On Oracle
Analyst Brad Reback reiterated a Hold rating while lifting the price target from $120 to $135.
Oracle's results missed Street estimates ""across the board,"" Reback said. He added, however, that the stock rose in extended trading on RPO growth accelerated to 44% and management’s guidance of double-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2025.
With accelerating infrastructure demand, Oracle signed AI contracts of $12 billion, which is more than twice the prior $5 billion year to date, highlighted by OpenAI and xAI deals, and a partnership with Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).

This week, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) kicked off the iOS 18 update, which included a new “Tap to Cash” service.

2024-06-12T17:26:37Z,AAPL,"A lower-than-expected inflation report for May ignited a bullish frenzy on Wall Street, with investors increasing their bets on rate cuts, bolstered by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will ease its policy stance later this year as price pressures trend towards the 2% target.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed cooler-than-anticipated monthly and annual inflation rates for both headline and core items. 
This report arrives just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will commence at 2:00 p.m. ET today.
The implied probability of a rate cut by September has surged to 72%, up from 54% before the inflation report. Fed futures now indicate a 55 basis points reduction (equivalent to two rate cuts) by year-end.
In response to rising expectations for rate cuts, traders quickly pivoted to riskier assets.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4% to over 19,400 points, setting new record highs. The S&P 500 Index increased by 1.1% to surpass 5,400 points, also achieving fresh all-time highs.

Lower PPI
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market took another leg up on Consumer Price Index (CPI) data yesterday. Please click here for details.
The chart shows that after the Fed announcement, the stock market pulled back as the dot plot was more hawkish than expected. Please see click here for details.
The chart shows that the stock market first jumped this morning on release of Producer Price Index (PPI) and jobless claims data.
RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is very overbought. Overbought markets tend to be susceptible to a pullback.
The chart shows that the volume was higher yesterday than other recent low volume days, but the volume was not high enough considering the strong rally. This is a negative.
Inflation at the producer level came cooler than expected. Here are the details:

Headline PPI came at -0.2% vs. 0.1% consensus.
Core PPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.3% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, a big part of the drop in PPI is because of the following reasons:

We have been sharing with readers that producer prices in China have been dropping. Since the U.S. imports a large amount of goods from China, China is exporting disflation to the U.S.
Oil prices have fallen due to concerns about a weak economy. Oil contributes significantly to PPI.


Weekly initial claims came at 242K vs. 224K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is weakening.  Initial jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories.  In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved.
The sentiment is extremely positive in addition to CPI, PPI, and jobless claims.  The following are adding to the positive sentiment.

What Happened: Technology giant NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently passed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to briefly become the most valuable company in the world.
The 200% gain for Nvidia shares in the last year has helped major stock indexes, but could also lead to changes from investors in the second half of 2024.
""I think we're a little out over our skis,"" Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods said in a CNBC interview.
Woods cited the major rebalancing of the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) that will see Nvidia as a larger holding. Woods also mentioned it was changing at the top for market capitalization dominance among the three companies.

The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSE:IWF) has surged by 6.5% so far in June 2024. This gain puts it on track for its seventh month of increases in the last eight.
Investors have shown elevated confidence in growth-oriented sectors, particularly technology, which continues to benefit from strong earnings reports, heightened expectations for future cash flows and positive market sentiment, especially towards AI-related industries.
In stark contrast, the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (NYSE:IWD), representing the other major equity style, has declined by 1.4% in June. 
This divergence highlights the challenges facing value stocks, which typically encompass sectors like financials, energy, utilities, and consumer staples. These sectors have struggled to attract investor interest due to their less impressive performance and subdued earnings expectations.

This disparity has prompted notable Wall Street veteran investor Ed Yardeni to comment that “the stock market has a bad breadth problem again.”
In a note sent to Yardeni Research’s subscribers on Sunday, the expert explained that while the past saw this issue due to the outperformance of the Magnificent 7 stocks, recently, it appears to be narrowing to the “Magnificent One,” namely Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA).

2024-06-24T17:52:09Z,AAPL,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) managed to stave off the Monday morning blues, poking its head above parity against Friday's close. On the other hand, semiconductor juggernaut NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) wasn't so lucky, slipping around 5% versus its previous end-of-session price. Due to the split fortunes in the tech space, MSFT stock represents the most valuable public equity with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion.
Both Microsoft and Nvidia have pinned their future on the blistering rise of artificial intelligence. For the former, the company partnered with OpenAI, the creator of popular chatbot ChatGPT. In addition, the tech giant has recently diversified into other global partnerships and startup investments.
Of course, Nvidia has been riding high on its advanced graphics processors that undergird the most rigorous AI protocols. Enterprise-level clients and government agencies continue to favor Nvidia's hardware.
However, Monday's rapid erosion of NVDA stock means that it's now trading below the $3 trillion market cap level. That puts it behind Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which presently carries a market cap of around $3.22 trillion.

What To Know: Monday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch,” Ives made the case that Apple is on the brink of an AI supercycle that will make it the face of the AI revolution for the consumer.
“I think for Apple right now, they’re at the top of the mountain because it’s their castle,” Ives said. 
Apple unveiled a slew of new AI-powered features at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) at the beginning of the month. Several analysts lifted price targets on Apple stock following WWDC, highlighting the company’s massive active installed base of more than 2.2 billion iOS devices.

2024-01-09T16:45:44Z,CRWD,"CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) shares are trading higher Tuesday on the back of an upgrade from Morgan Stanley.
Analyst Take: Morgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala upgraded CrowdStrike from an Equal-Weight rating to an Overweight rating and raised the price target from $203 to $304, citing improving demand, platform traction and upcoming AI product cycles.
The Morgan Stanley analyst expects increased demand and traction to help drive more meaningful upside to annual recurring revenue and free cash flow forecasts in 2024. 
Despite CrowdStrike’s significant outperformance over the last year, with shares rallying more than 185%, Fodderwala expects the aforementioned catalysts to drive the stock higher over the course of the year.

Rise Of AI Investments
Daniel Ives and his team at Wedbush predict a surge in technological investments towards AI in the coming decade. This anticipation stems from the evident monetization of AI technologies, as demonstrated in recent earnings reports across the tech sector.

2024-02-21T11:51:21Z,CRWD,"Wall Street remains subdued following Tuesday’s sell-off, primarily driven by small-cap and tech stocks. All eyes are now on Nvidia Corp.‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for after the closing bell.
Given the crucial nature of this event, caution is likely to be the predominant sentiment with investors anxiously awaiting Nvidia’s performance. This anticipation is further amplified by the uncertainty surrounding its ability to meet the lofty expectations placed upon it.
Adding to the market’s concerns are upcoming speeches by Federal Reserve officials and, more importantly, the Fed minutes. Both pronouncements hold the potential to shed light on the future trajectory of interest rates, another significant factor influencing investor sentiment.
Cues From Tuesday’s Trading:
Three key developments weighed down the markets on Tuesday:

Mixed retail earnings: Performance reports from retailers painted a mixed picture, leaving investors unsure about the health of the consumer sector.
Nvidia anxiety: Apprehension mounted regarding Nvidia’s ability to live up to the high expectations set for its upcoming earnings report.
Leading economic index decline: The Conference Board’s leading economic index experienced a larger-than-anticipated drop, raising concerns about future economic growth.

These factors contributed to a negative market atmosphere, pushing major averages down:

Tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500: Both opened lower and remained below the flatline throughout the session. The S&P 500 even dipped below the psychological barrier of 5,000.
Dow: The Dow experienced some morning volatility but ultimately closed lower.
Small-caps: The Russell 2000 underperformed, dropping 1.41%.
Sectors: Only consumer staples, led by Walmart’s positive results, managed to escape the overall decline. Conversely, IT and consumer discretionary stocks took the biggest hits.

2024-02-28T13:52:11Z,CRWD,"Shares in Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) are bouncing back this week following a steep drop last week after it reported weaker-than-expected earnings guidance.
The shares fell 28% after CEO Nikesh Arora noted in a conference call following the results, that clients were beginning to show signs of “spending fatigue” — even as online cybersecurity threats increased.
Shares in Palo Alto’s sector rivals fell in sympathy, with CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) down around 10% on the day and Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS) falling nearly 15%.
Of course, customers are getting spending fatigue. Cybersecurity costs rise in tandem with the growing risk of attack and complexity of threat. It’s simply one rising annual cost chief technology officers will have to get used to.
Pricing should remain competitive as more players enter what is currently not regarded as an overcrowded market.

2024-03-05T11:38:25Z,CRWD,"After soaring to record highs last week, traders are taking a wait-and-see approach as they anticipate a series of upcoming market-moving events. Following Monday’s pullback, stock futures are trading slightly down on Tuesday morning, with mega-cap tech leading the decline.
Analysts suggest this pre-market weakness may reflect traders taking profits ahead of key events this week, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‘s Congressional testimony.
Cues From Monday’s Session:
Stocks reversed course on Monday, with concerns about overbought conditions prompting investors to exercise caution.
The major averages opened lower and remained mostly flat throughout the day, except for a brief rally in late afternoon trading.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite retreated from their all-time highs, while small-cap stocks in the Russell 2,000 Index showed stronger resilience, only declining in late trading.
Defensive sectors like utilities and real estate led the gains, while communication services, consumer discretionary, and energy stocks faced significant selling pressure.

Analyst Color:
A fund manager on Monday reaffirmed his bullish stance on equities. “While some investors are now questioning the strength across so many market sectors, and the surprising lack of hedging for an inevitable correction, it is interesting to note that historically, when the S&P is up in the first 2 months of the year, it has a positive full-year return 96% of the time, with an annual increase of 20.2%,” said Louis Navellier. 
“When a pullback comes, it seems likely that money will flow off the sidelines seeing it as a ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/24/03/37477255/nasdaq-futures-slide-on-mega-cap-tech-weakness-analyst-paints-1999-like-rosy-picture-tells-investor

All the Magnificent Seven names experienced losses. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) nosedived over 4%, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ AAPL) shed 2.7%, marking its fifth consecutive session of losses.

2024-03-06T11:38:20Z,CRWD,"U.S. stocks are on track to rebound on Wednesday after experiencing a pullback in the previous two sessions. Pent-up buying could lift heavily weighted tech stocks and, consequently, the broader market. However, several factors will influence the market’s direction.
Investors will closely watch Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‘s comments on inflation and potential monetary policy adjustments in a testimony to the House of Representatives. While a significant shift in stance is unlikely, any deviation from his recent hawkish tone could impact markets.
Upcoming data releases on the job market could offer insights into the economy’s health and potentially influence the Fed’s monetary policy decisions.
While the Super Tuesday primary results largely met expectations and may not significantly alter Wednesday’s market outlook, they remain a potential factor to watch.
Some portfolio managers view the recent pullback as a positive development. “As much as profit-taking when at all-time highs is rational, the huge amount of the money on the sidelines likely has been waiting for a pullback to add to their exposure,” said Louis Navellier.
Cues From Tuesday’s Session:
Dragged by weakness in most mega-tap tech stocks, the major averages fell sharply on Tuesday. The setback came amid nervousness about the overbought levels, especially as traders looked ahead to some key Main Street catalysts. 
The major indices opened lower and languished below the unchanged line throughout the session. While the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled at two-week lows, the Nasdaq Composite pulled back toward its lowest in a week.
Among S&P sector classes, IT stocks experienced the biggest declines followed by consumer discretionary, real estate and communication services stocks. On the other hand, consumer staple, energy and financial stocks rose modestly.

The results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways from the release.
Piper Sandler On CrowdStrike
Analyst Rob Owens reiterated an Overweight rating while raising the price target from $300 to $400.
CrowdStrike reported ARR (annual recurring revenue) of $3.44 billion, up 34% year-on-year, and around $40 million higher than Street expectations, Owens said in a note. “Accelerating NNARR growth of +27% punctuated a strong end to the year for CRWD,” he added.
“Platform traction and momentum remain compelling, and management's confidence behind its strategy is unwavering despite comments and GTM strategy changes noted by competitors recently,” the analyst further wrote.
BMO Capital Markets On CrowdStrike
Analyst Keith Bachman maintained an Outperform rating while lifting the price target from $332 to $425.
CrowdStrike net new ARR of $282 million was the highlight of the quarter and was “even higher than buyside expectations, in our judgment,” Bachman said.
He added that the company’s robust quarter and guidance “stand apart from other security reports,” which raised “incremental concerns” around Palo Alto Networks Inc.’s (NASDAQ: PANW) recent challenges.
Stifel On CrowdStrike
Analyst Adam C. Borg reaffirmed a Buy rating, while raising the price target from $315 to $400.
“Despite fears of fatigue/pricing pressure, CrowdStrike delivered a strong close to FY24, with all key top-line/bottom-line metrics above expectations,” Borg wrote in a note.
“Growing traction across emerging Cloud/Identity/LogScale opportunities, which collectively drove $850M+ in ending ARR (+100% Y/Y),” the analyst stated. He added that CrowdStrike is among “a handful of vendors well-positioned to capitalize on cybersecurity platform consolidation as it pursues $10B in ARR in coming years.”
RBC Capital Markets On CrowdStrike
Analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated an Outperform rating while lifting the price target from $357 to $420.
CrowdStrike delivered upbeat quarterly results even again high expectations, “driven by broad-based momentum and large deal traction with +34% ARR growth, +33% revenue growth and 33% FCF margin,” Hedberg said.
“Despite spending concerns raised by PANW, CRWD continues to execute well and consolidate cyber spending as it remains a top long-term pick,” he added.

Under the leadership of Jensen Huang, Nvidia will likely reveal groundbreaking products, partnerships, and use cases that will propel the next phase of the AI Revolution, as per the analyst. 
The event will likely set off a tidal wave of spending in the tech sector, with a forecast of over $1 trillion in AI investments over the next decade, he said. 
This surge reflected the proliferation of enterprise and consumer applications in what is being termed the 4th Industrial Revolution.

The event, dubbed as the “AI Woodstock” by Bank of America analysts, underscored the growing excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to reshape the technology landscape.
Bank of America’s Vivek Arya highlighted the increasing influence of generative AI and the concept of omniverse/digital twins across a broad spectrum of industries. 
Arya suggested the potential to re-architect a staggering $1-$2 trillion of global computing infrastructure with accelerators, envisioning a market that could grow to $250-$500 billion annually over the next three to five years. This expansion is further supported by growing enterprise use cases and demand from various sovereign entities.
This optimistic view led the investment bank to raise its price target for Nvidia from $925 to $1,100, showcasing a stronger-than-consesus call on the major AI player.

2024-03-29T06:24:23Z,CRWD,"The first quarter of 2024 has turned out to be a blockbuster for most asset classes, and the strong performances have left investors worried about the sustainability of the uptrend.
How long will the party last? What are the risks involved in investing in an overbought market? Benzinga collated views from analysts and economists to make sense of the rally so far and zero in on the opportunities that could pay off in the near to medium term.
Equity Market — From Shaky Start To Strong Surge: The equity market kicked off the new year with a whimper, with concerns that 2023’s gains might not hold. However, the momentum from last year carried through, quashing skepticism and propelling the market to new highs.
Three months in, the S&P 500 Index has notched record highs for both closing and intraday trading. Blue-chip stocks mirrored this performance, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing the quarter at a fresh record. 
Tech stocks were once again at the forefront, fueled by the AI boom that spurred gains for companies of all sizes. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite couldn’t quite reach its record peak as valuation concerns prompted some profit-taking near the quarter’s end.

                               Source: Benzinga 
The more heartening aspect of the recent rally is that, unlike in 2023 when it was nearly exclusively fueled by tech, this time around, the participation has broadened. 
LPL Financial‘s Chief Technical Strategist, Adam Turnquist, said in a recent note that the strong uptrend in the S&P 500 Index is supported by broad participation and cyclical leadership. “Improving relative strength in industrials, financials, and materials provides additional evidence of a bullish rotation that has largely been overshadowed by mega-caps and AI enthusiasm,” he said.

AI optimism drove much of the upside early in the quarter, with stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp.

2024-05-16T17:47:29Z,CRWD,"Piper Sandler analyst Brent A. Bracelin attended Virtual Iceberg Summit 2024 sessions over the last two days with data architects and engineers from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), ByteDance, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), EBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) LinkedIn, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), Tencent, and Uber Technologies, Inc (NYSE:UBER).
Bracelin reiterated an Overweight rating on Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) with a price target of $240.
From his standpoint, the industry takeaways were that Iceberg adoption is still nascent, less than 200 attendees per session suggests Iceberg is still in the hands of early adopters, and broader enterprise adoption of Iceberg across the Global 2000 could still be much further out, with most use cases in the hands of the biggest open-source users and advocates.

2024-05-21T12:10:08Z,CRWD,"In an exclusive interview with Benzinga, Jeremy Schwartz, Global Chief Investment Officer at WisdomTree, shared his insights on sectors and themes that are currently capturing the firm's attention. 
As we navigate through the first half of 2024, he pointed to one area that stands out prominently: artificial intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential across various industries.
AI: The Game Changer For 2024
Schwartz highlighted that global corporations are investing heavily in computing infrastructure, with over $100 billion being allocated annually. 
“We are also observing the emergence of superior chatbots and ""CoPilots"" that optimize existing software as well as conversations about how AI has the potential to increase productivity across nearly every industry,” said Schwartz. 
These advancements underscore AI’s potential to boost productivity across nearly every sector, a trend that investors cannot afford to overlook.
Thematic ETFs: Diversified Exposure To AI
To capture alpha from AI’s potential, Schwartz advocates that “investors can get diverse exposure to AI, beyond the likes of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) that so many others are focusing on.”

Tech stocks were sliding premarket as reports suggested China is seriously contemplating cutting reliance completely on the United States in chipmaking, while meme stocks seemed to have lost their fizzle. Given the recent soft readings, traders may look to the factory goods orders and the JOLTS survey results. Bond yields continue to edge lower, baking in expectations of softer growth likely facilitating downward adjustments of the Fed funds rate.

This downturn was primarily instigated by a widespread sell-off in the technology sector, as investors adopted a more cautious stance following a robust market rally in the final two months of 2023. 
Interestingly, not all segments of the equity market were equally affected by this early-year turbulence. Value-related stocks managed to weather the storm, avoiding losses and even posting modest gains during the first trading session of the year.
Notably, the iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF (NYSE:IUSV) closed 0.6% higher on Jan. 2, reaching new all-time highs.

2024-01-04T19:11:26Z,JPM,"The possibility of a soft landing for the U.S. economy is gaining traction, prompting an increased interest in U.S. banking stocks, as Bank of America revealed in a note to clients on Thursday. 
The group of Bank of America’s equity analysts, led by Ebrahim H. Poonawala, point out several key factors that might fuel a bullish trend in banking stocks this year. This optimism is rooted in the changing economic landscape, expected policy shifts and the strategic positioning of individual banks.
“We see potential for an overshoot in bank stocks,” analysts wrote in the note. 
“Increasing confidence that interest rates headed lower, economy avoiding a recession, and GDP accelerating in the second half of the year should see a continued re-rating higher in stocks,” they added. 
The market reaction was positive following the note. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) increased by 1% on Thursday, reaching highs not seen since late April 2022. Similarly, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) rallied by 1%, and rose 35% since late October 2023.

2024-01-05T12:36:42Z,JPM,"Stocks could be headed lower yet again on Friday, with the market off to a rocky start for the year. Technology stocks are getting thrashed amid the risk aversion in play. The all-important jobs report holds the key to determining the day’s trading direction.
Important metrics to track, according to LPL Chief Economist Jeffrey Roach, are the flow of individuals entering the labor force and the ratio of part-time workers to full-timers. More people coming off the sidelines will increase the unemployment rate, he said.
A stronger-than-expected report could push yields higher, creating further downward pressure on the market.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
The stock market continued to grind lower in the new year, with the major averages trading mostly lower on Thursday. The weakness was the result of investors’ skepticism regarding the ability of the market to sustain the strong upward momentum seen for much of 2023 amid the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.
ADP’s private sector payrolls report showed bigger than expected job gains and the weekly jobless claims fell more than expected in the recent reporting week, while S&P Global’s service sector survey showed anemic expansion in December, in line with expectations. Both the labor market reports vouched for the strength of the labor market, casting a cloud on a Fed rate cut.
The major averages opened the session slightly but reversed course in early trading. The broader S&P 500 Index and the 30-stock Dow Industrials hovered mostly above the unchanged but diverged at the close. The Dow ended marginally higher, while the latter settled modestly lower.
Techs once again acted as the biggest drags, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded below the unchanged line for the better part of the session before ending moderately lower. Consumer discretionary and energy stocks also pulled back notably.

2024-01-08T13:17:32Z,JPM,"As the U.S.’s prominent banking institutions prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings, a significant surge in bad debts poses a risk to the growing investor confidence in the sector.
What Happened: The Financial Times reported on Monday that non-performing loans at the four largest U.S. banks are estimated to have ballooned to a combined $24.4 billion in the last quarter of 2023, an increase of nearly $6 billion from the end of 2022.
Analysts are projecting a decline in bank earnings for the last quarter of 2023, partly influenced by these unpaid loans and the lingering effects of higher interest rates, which have driven up deposit costs.
Additionally, several big banks are expected to incur a one-time charge by the end of the year, as they have agreed to a special assessment imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to recoup the $18.5 billion that last year’s failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature cost the regulator’s insurance fund.

2024-01-08T14:34:11Z,JPM,"Equity markets remain under pressure on Monday as investors await the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season for guidance on whether the rally of November and December could be resumed in January.
Last week was the first down week for U.S. stocks following nine-consecutive weeks of gains for the S&P 500 index and for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), the exchange traded fund that mirrors the index’s moves. After gaining 16% in the most recent stage of a powerful 2023 rally, last week the index lost 1.6%.

Why Are Equity Markets Moving Lower In January?
Several factors are at play here:

Some analysts believe that after a prolonged rally, stock valuations are at levels where profit taking looks attractive
Markets have gotten ahead of themselves on Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, and the likely real pace of cuts are now fully priced in

Deloitte, in its 2024 Banking And Capital Markets Outlook, has already noted that this will be a challenging year as financial services companies grapple with a slowing global economy, cuts in interest rates, continued geopolitical tensions and more assertive regulations.
But there are likely to be other disruptive forces at work. Not least the exponential pace at which new technologies are likely to be adopted, adding layers of risk and raising capital spending costs.

2024-01-12T12:21:24Z,JPM,"U.S. stocks are gearing up for a weaker open on Friday, following a resilient performance on Thursday despite a larger-than-expected increase in December consumer price inflation. Disappointing earnings news has added downward pressure to equities, and now the focus shifts to the upcoming producer price inflation report before the market opens. This report will determine whether the rise in pricing pressure is evident at the wholesale level, potentially influencing retail levels in the months ahead.
Cues From Thursday’s Trading:
Following Thursday’s consumer price inflation report, stocks initially had a mixed start but later moved uniformly higher in early trading. However, the indices changed course after reaching session highs, pulling back to lows by early afternoon as traders digested the inflation data. Stocks then reversed course once again, steadily rising in the afternoon, resulting in a narrowly mixed session.
The Nasdaq Composite closed almost flat with a slight positive bias, and the Dow Industrials ended marginally higher, while the S&P 500 Index closed with a slight loss. The modest gain of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index extended its winning streak to five consecutive sessions.
In terms of sectors, most ended lower for the session, except IT, IT services, and energy stocks. Utility stocks, in particular, experienced more acute weakness.
During the session, small-cap stocks underperformed their large-cap counterparts, as evidenced by the 0.75% pullback by the Russell 2,000 Index.

He also singled out the risks facing the economy. “It is important to note that the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus,” he said.

Furthermore, American consumer sentiment appears to be on the upswing, with a notable economist challenging economic pessimism. Let’s delve into these stories.
Gundlach’s S&P 500 Warning: Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, recently shared his concerns about potential risks in the S&P 500. In a public webcast, the billionaire investor labeled the S&P 500 as a “pretty lousy trade location to own stocks”, suggesting underperformance of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks compared to the broader market. Read the full article here.
Ray Dalio on 2024: Billionaire and hedge-fund veteran Ray Dalio has forecasted that the year 2024 will be pivotal.

Data collected by HSBC Global Research show that the global birth rate has fallen by 4.5% in 2023. South Korea’s rate has fallen by the most, down 8.5%, while Germany’s was down 6%. In the U.S. the birth rate is still growing, but at a much slower rate since the global financial crisis in 2008.
“The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic was expected to see a rebound in birth rates across the world – but the opposite is happening,” said James Pomeroy, global economist at HSBC Global Research.
Social And Economic Impact On Young People
The reasons appear to be a mixture of many reasons, both economic and social. Young people struggle to afford homes in which to raise families, as well as the broader costs of bringing up children. Meanwhile, many younger people are prioritizing their careers or desire to travel ahead of starting families.
Much of this means that those who do plan families are having children at a much later stage in their lives than would have been the norm several decades ago. Thus, many are limiting their families to just one child.

They pointed to underwhelming earnings results and inflated valuations as reasons for potential risk in the current stock market. The strategists also anticipate challenges from consumer companies, with a possible impact from dwindling household savings and slowing growth in China.
They also warned that high expectations for artificial intelligence companies could lead to significant stock market turbulence if these expectations are not met.

What Happened: In the panel discussion on Friday, Dimon expressed unease over the escalating U.S. national debt, as reported by Business Insider. The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio currently sits at approximately 120%, with the national debt exceeding $34 trillion. Dimon anticipates the debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 130% by 2035.
Dimon warned of the worldwide implications of the U.S. debt, as foreigners hold $7.6 trillion of the debt. “That hockey stick doesn’t start yet,” he said. 
“When it starts, markets around the world… there will be a rebellion,” he added. 
According to Dimon, the rising debt could exceed the U.S. government’s total revenue by 2030, as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
“This is about the security of the world,” Dimon emphasized, underscoring the need for a stronger America and military.

What Happened: Dimon, speaking at the JPMorgan High Yield and Leveraged Finance Conference in Miami on Monday, cautioned that the U.S. might be on the brink of a recession. Despite this, he does not foresee any systemic issues, reported CNBC.
Dimon pointed out that there are concerns about certain factors and expressed disagreement with the high probability assigned to the economy avoiding a recession.
Dimon highlighted several factors that could impact the economy, including the market’s current pricing of a “soft landing,” the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening, and the U.S.’s fiscal spending deficits. He believes that these factors might play out over several years, potentially causing a significant impact.
""The market is kind of pricing in a soft landing. That may very well happen. But the [market's] odds are 70 to 80%. I'll give you half that, that's all,"" said Dimon, according to the report.

Of particular note were the U.S. Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations and the escalating fears of Americans regarding the national debt crisis. Additionally, the market was rife with speculation concerning the possibility of a recession, a potential second term for Trump, and probing questions about the US monetary policy from El Salvador’s President.
Fed’s Inflation Gauge Aligns With Predictions, signifying progression toward the 2% inflation target. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, hit the mark in January. This comes amidst traders’ expectations of a Federal rate cut by the end of H1. The impact was immediately felt in the Treasury market, with yields across the board falling, including a dip in the 10-year benchmark yield to 4.28% shortly after the PCE release.

What Happened: Dimon made these remarks on Tuesday at the Australian Financial Review Business Summit, reported Bloomberg. He stated, “We don't manage off a base case, we manage off the full spectrum of risk.”
Dimon’s comments come in the wake of concerns about a potential recession in the US. Just last month, the JPMorgan CEO had expressed his apprehensions about the U.S. economy, warning of a possible recession and the market’s underestimation of the risks. Despite this, he did not foresee any systemic issues.

Hotter Inflation 
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market is hovering above the trendline.
The chart shows when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was last reported, the stock market fell as CPI was hotter than expected.
The difference between when CPI was reported last time as shown on the chart and the CPI release this time is that stock market euphoria has significantly expanded.  
The chart shows that the stock market is rising after the CPI report today.
CPI came hotter than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.
Core CPI came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus and 0.2% whisper number.


On a micro level, the stock market quickly dipped after the release of the hotter than expected CPI, but then the momo crowd stepped in to aggressively buy the dip.
If the stock market was in a rational phase, it would have seen a big drop today on the hotter than expected CPI. However, the stock market is in a euphoric phase. In a euphoric phase, bad news is good news, and good news is great news. A characteristic of the euphoric phase is that all news is bought, irrespective of what it is.  
Momo gurus have a new highly flawed narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The narrative is that year-over-year inflation came at 3.2% vs. 3.1% consensus.
As we have shared with you several times along the way, looking solely at year-over-year is like driving while looking only in the rearview mirror. Investors should look at month-over-month for the last three months – this is like looking through the windshield. Investors should also look at year-over-year, but that is like looking through the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/economics/24/03/37623349/inflation-hotter-than-expected-momo-buys-the-bad-news-jp-morgan-ceo-says-recession-not-off-the-table

2024-04-08T15:50:57Z,JPM,"Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), remains concerned about stickier inflationary pressures and higher interest rates than investors currently expect. 
What Happened: In his latest shareholder letter, Dimon identified several inflationary factors including the need for increased spending, the shift towards a greener economy, the restructuring of global supply chains, heightened military expenditures, and rising healthcare costs.
Dimon’s letter also cited the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, increasing terrorist threats, and escalating tensions with China. 
Despite these challenges, Dimon praised the U.S. economy’s resiliency, underscored by robust consumer spending. However, he remains skeptical regarding the prevalent market optimism for a soft economic landing. 
“Markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing — modest growth along with declining inflation and interest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower than that,” he said. 
Dimon claimed that the company is ready for a wide spectrum of interest rate scenarios, ranging from 2% to 8% or possibly higher, ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/news/econ-s/24/04/38145762/jamie-dimon-warns-of-stickier-inflation-higher-interest-rates-in-annual-jpmorgan-letter-there-will-b

For many years, observers have wondered when the behemoths of traditional finance, like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM), would finally enter the blockchain arena in a big way. The expectation that these bellwethers of global finance would, in a sense, “see the light” by acknowledging the technological advantages of web3 was perhaps a little naive. But it was not unfounded: traditional investors have been making incremental shifts in this direction for some time, whether by investing in spot cryptocurrency, launching custody services, settling digital bonds on public ledgers, or creating their own product offerings for retail and institutional clients.
The argument that blockchain and cryptocurrencies must be embraced by traditional powerhouses in order to flourish is a sound one. But the heavy focus on legacy financial institutions overlooks something important: the rise of crypto-native institutions. Rather than having to be convinced of the merits of distributed ledgers, these forward-looking innovators and investors grew up with decentralized tech at the heart of their operations and vision. And make no mistake, they will be the ones to drive the industry – and maybe finance as a whole – forward.
We Were Always Here: The Vitality of Crypto-Native Institutions
As the crypto industry has matured, a new breed of institution has emerged. These are not your traditional Wall Street firms belatedly flirting with blockchain tech; they are entities that fundamentally understand and appreciate the ethos of decentralization. They get the tech, and the reasons for its development, at an instinctive level. They have been an integral part of Web3 since the technology’s inception, and have evolved together with it. From the beginning, these institutions have been key drivers in the industry’s advancement through major milestones, from the rise ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/38147478/the-institutions-are-already-in-crypto-why-web3-natives-are-in-the-drivers-seat

2024-05-15T20:27:04Z,JPM,"Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), raised concerns about the perilous state of the U.S. fiscal deficit, which has swelled to a staggering $1.9 trillion in 2024. This deficit, amounting to over 6% of the nation's GDP, shows no signs of diminishing in the coming years. 
“We spent a lot of money during COVID and after COVID, and our deficit is 6%,” Dimon remarked in an exclusive interview with the UK’s Sky News on Wednesday, highlighting the significant impact of recent government spending. 
Despite the benefits of such spending in driving economic growth during and after the pandemic, Dimon warned that unrestrained borrowing and spending could have dire consequences. “It may not always lead to good growth,” he cautioned.

Yet, in a twist fit for a financial thriller, the sleeping investors failed to capitalize on this advance peek, missing out on what could have been a golden opportunity to gain from trading.
On a day when microseconds can mean huge returns, the early availability of Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures should have set off a frenzy of buying and selling. 
The CPI data, meticulously watched by traders, highly influences global asset prices and Federal Reserve policy. Under normal circumstances, these figures are unveiled with extreme precision at 8:30 a.m. Washington time, surrounded by high security to prevent leaks.
However, this Wednesday was different. “In advance of today's CPI and Real Earnings releases, BLS inadvertently loaded a subset of files to the website approximately 30 minutes prior to the release,” the Bureau admitted in a post-incident statement.

What Happened: Dimon, highlighted the various factors contributing to the ongoing inflation. These include costs associated with the green economy, re-militarization, infrastructure spending, and substantial fiscal deficits.

High credit card rates and enduring inflation are hurting consumers, especially those considered “Gen Z.” Here’s the latest New York Fed data about the American consumer.
The Data: The New York Fed's Center for Microeconomic Data released its quarterly credit card debt report on Tuesday. Although credit card balances fell by $14 billion in the first quarter, many borrowers are behind on their credit payments. 
The report connected utilization rates with the probability of delinquency. A high 90% to 100% utilization rate has become increasingly common since the COVID-19 pandemic; these borrowers are unsurprisingly more likely to fall behind on payments and become delinquent.

In April, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3.4% compared to the same month last year, down slightly from March's 3.5% annual rate and matching estimates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the 40,000 mark on Thursday, pushing its bull market rally to nearly a 25% surge since October.

Although the 2024 Stress Tests confirmed that all 31 banks analyzed would meet the minimum capital requirements even during a severe crisis, the potential losses these banks would face are projected to be higher than the previous year.
Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden noted that the Stress Test results “were broadly worse than expected for the banks.”
Ramsden explained that the year-over-year change in results was largely driven by banks generating much lower pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) during the test period. For the largest banks, PPNR fell by 9% year-over-year. 
Additionally, there were higher credit losses and provisions, particularly in commercial and industrial loans (C&I) and credit card sectors.

2024-01-05T12:36:42Z,PLTR,"Stocks could be headed lower yet again on Friday, with the market off to a rocky start for the year. Technology stocks are getting thrashed amid the risk aversion in play. The all-important jobs report holds the key to determining the day’s trading direction.
Important metrics to track, according to LPL Chief Economist Jeffrey Roach, are the flow of individuals entering the labor force and the ratio of part-time workers to full-timers. More people coming off the sidelines will increase the unemployment rate, he said.
A stronger-than-expected report could push yields higher, creating further downward pressure on the market.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
The stock market continued to grind lower in the new year, with the major averages trading mostly lower on Thursday. The weakness was the result of investors’ skepticism regarding the ability of the market to sustain the strong upward momentum seen for much of 2023 amid the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.
ADP’s private sector payrolls report showed bigger than expected job gains and the weekly jobless claims fell more than expected in the recent reporting week, while S&P Global’s service sector survey showed anemic expansion in December, in line with expectations. Both the labor market reports vouched for the strength of the labor market, casting a cloud on a Fed rate cut.
The major averages opened the session slightly but reversed course in early trading. The broader S&P 500 Index and the 30-stock Dow Industrials hovered mostly above the unchanged but diverged at the close. The Dow ended marginally higher, while the latter settled modestly lower.
Techs once again acted as the biggest drags, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded below the unchanged line for the better part of the session before ending moderately lower. Consumer discretionary and energy stocks also pulled back notably.

2024-01-08T16:33:53Z,PLTR,"NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) are two popular investor choices when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI). 
Both stocks have had a good run in 2023, with Nvidia stock up 245% and Palantir stock up 168%. In 2024, investors’ key questions are:

Is there more room to run?
Which stock offers more upside?

Let’s first look at whether there’s more room to run. Nvidia’s stock is currently trading at around $490.
Consensus price target for the stock stands at $600. This implies an upside over 20% for Nvidia stock. 
Moreover, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya is bullish on Nvidia’s strategic trajectory. Arya sees Nvidia’s next two years being fueled by robust FCF and an evolving approach to recurring revenue.

Stronger-than-expected economic data — and comments from Federal Reserve officials indicating the central bank has no immediate plans to reduce rates — pushed major U.S. stock averages into the red.
Both Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari issued warnings that monetary policy may remain restrictive for a while due to the remarkable economic resilience.
In January, the services sector expanded beyond expectations, as indicated by the latest ISM PMI figures, marking the strongest growth since September 2023 and extending its 13th consecutive month of expansion.
Traders have now embraced the idea that a rate cut in March is off the table. Furthermore, they are reducing their rate cut expectations for 2024, going from six rate cuts last week to just about five as of Monday.

2024-02-06T12:37:37Z,PLTR,"U.S. stocks are poised for another day of weakness, although some positive tech earnings may provide a modest lift to the sector. The market appears to be digesting information following a rally that began after the early January downturn. According to a recent report from FactSet, estimated earnings growth for S&P 500 companies has turned upward as more companies report earnings beats by a wide margin. Additionally, speeches from Federal Reserve officials scheduled for the day could influence trading.
Cues From Monday's Trading:
Major indices paused on Monday due to concerns about overbought levels, prompting caution among investors. Federal Reserve commentary suggested that the central bank may refrain from cutting rates until evidence of a sustained downtrend in inflation emerges.
The Institute of Supply Management’s service sector reading added to concerns about delayed rate cuts from the Fed. The survey showed “economy growing solidly in early 2024 and prices rising, further reducing odds of a March rate cut,” said Comerica Chief Economist Bill Adams.
Indices opened lower and extended losses in early trading before rebounding from lows later in the morning. However, they still ended the day down, with both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Industrials retreating from record levels.
All sectors, except healthcare stocks, experienced declines, with material, utility, and real estate stocks particularly affected by the sell-off.

Evidence of AI Growth: Ives cited Microsoft Corp.‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strong performance, particularly the high demand for its Copilot AI tool, as early proof of the trend.
Ives, who has called Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) “The Messi of AI,” applauded its “homerun” with its commercial AI platform. 
He referenced Nvidia Corp.‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) positive results, including both strong financials and optimistic forecasts, as further validation. “Last week, the Godfather of AI Jensen [Huang] spoke and the world listened,” Ives said of Nvidia’s CEO.

2024-03-07T11:43:43Z,PLTR,"U.S. stock futures indicate a higher opening on Thursday following the market’s two-session losing streak, buoyed by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s seemingly dovish commentary. Bond yields are declining as the market anticipates Fed funds rate cuts this year. Investors await further insights from Powell and other Fed officials to clarify the interest rate outlook.
Traders are also monitoring developments surrounding the regional banking crisis after New York Community Bancorp, Inc.‘s (NYSE:NYCB) bailout, along with various job market indicators.
Cues From Wednesday’s Session:
Powell’s comments were interpreted by traders as suggesting potential rate cuts this year, contributing to Wednesday’s market rebound. Major indices opened higher after February’s ADP private payroll data slightly missed expectations. Despite relinquishing some gains before Powell’s prepared speech, stocks reversed course following the Fed chief’s indication of likely rate reductions this year, contingent upon inflation returning to the 2% target.
While indices peaked around mid-session, they later retraced some gains but ultimately closed higher for the day.
Most S&P 500 sector classes closed in positive territory, with consumer staples, IT, and utility stocks leading the gains.

Stocks of just seven large technology companies, known as the Magnificent 7, currently represent about 30% of the index's total market capitalization, a historically high level, said Morgan Stanley’s Chief Investor Officer Lisa Shalett. 
“While there may be room for these high-flying mega-caps to rise even further, their outsized presence in benchmark indices creates risk for investors,” she said. “Should even one of them tumble, it could deal a considerable blow to even a cautious investor's portfolio.”

2024-05-01T03:26:44Z,PLTR,"On Tuesday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest made significant trades, with the most prominent ones involving BYD Co Ltd (OTC:BYDDY) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR).
The BYD Co. Trade
Ark Invest, through its ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ), purchased 18,748 shares of BYD Co Ltd. Based on the closing price of $54.47 on the same day, the estimated value of this trade is approximately $1.02 million. This move comes in the wake of a debate between the late billionaire investor Charlie Munger and Wood over the superiority of Tesla, Inc and BYD in the electric vehicle market.
Wood had defended Tesla, a key holding of Ark Innovation ETF, arguing that the lower costs associated with technologically enabled innovation in batteries and drivetrains would cause a boom in unit demand. This move by Ark Invest may indicate a broader strategy to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market.

2024-05-06T11:09:27Z,PLTR,"U.S. stocks are likely to extend their gains as major index futures are modestly higher on Monday. Strong earnings reports continue to support the market, with S&P 500 earnings expected to grow by 5% year-over-year — the highest rate since Q2 2022. The possibility of rate cuts has re-emerged, making this week’s flurry of Fed speeches potentially market-moving events. Analysts are confident the upward momentum will continue after a slow April, with the typical strength seen in election years (over the next three months) likely aiding the rally.

Cues From Previous Session 
A dovish Federal Reserve message, benign economic data, and positive earnings reports fueled the market rally for a second consecutive week. All three major indices closed the week ending May 3 firmly in positive territory. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn’t provide a specific timeline for rate cuts, he reassured investors by clarifying that hikes are not on the immediate horizon. Big tech companies like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) met analyst expectations with their earnings reports.
The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector reading fell sharply and dipped into contraction territory. However, the monthly non-farm payrolls report offered mixed signals: lower-than-expected job growth in April, a slight increase in the unemployment rate, and slower-than-expected wage growth.

Bullish analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush weighed in on Palantir’s performance. 
Top-line Beat: Overall, Palantir delivered another “Jalen Brunson-like” performance — referring to the New York Knicks point guard — with its AIP leading the way, said Ives in a note. 
He noted that total revenue climbed 21% year-over-year to $634.3 million, exceeding the consensus estimate of $615.3 million and the guidance range of $612 million to $616 million.
The analyst attributes the top-line outperformance to the continued adoption of their Foundry platform (AIP) across both commercial and government sectors.

Rising bond yields proved to be the undoing of the market on Wednesday, as the major indices closed uniformly lower. The averages opened down as the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hovered above the 4.6% level. The indices moved sideways around these depressed levels before ending notably lower.
The Dow Jones Industrials Average closed at its lowest since early May and the broader S&P 500 Index retreated to a two-week low.
The sell-off was across the board, with the weakness more pronounced in energy, industrial, real estate, material and utility stocks.

AMD Stock: “Could Easily Hit $200“
Wool said AMD is positioned to benefit significantly from Nvidia’s sharp rise.
Despite its relatively modest movement — up about 10% year-to-date and 30% over the past 12 months — Wool sees substantial potential for AMD.
“I think AMD trading in the mid-$160s could easily hit $200, given the amount of money that’s gonna continue to pour into AI,” said Wool. 
Wool’s optimism stems from the continuous influx of investment into the AI sector, which heavily relies on high-performance chips like those produced by AMD.

Fed speeches will once again be in the spotlight as traders digest comments from three officials on the monetary-policy setting committee.
The retail sales report and the Fed’s Beige Book could add some volatility to the market. Analysts are generally optimistic about the fourth-quarter season, citing a lowered bar and ongoing demand recovery. The upcoming tech earnings, starting next week, are expected to play a crucial role in determining the short-term market direction.
Cues From Tuesday’s Trading:
U.S. stocks closed in the red on Tuesday as concerns about interest rates and economic growth prompted a defensive stance among traders. The major indices opened significantly lower after regional manufacturing activity data fell sharply to the lowest level since May 2020. Mixed bank earnings and a further decline in Boeing Co.‘s (NYSE:BA) shares also contributed to the negative sentiment.
Although the indices recovered some ground in late-morning trading, with the Nasdaq Composite briefly moving above the unchanged line, they retreated after a Fed official downplayed hopes of a rate cut.
Most S&P 500 sector stocks, except for IT stocks, ended the day lower, with notable declines in the energy, utility, material, industrial, and utility sectors.

Also, the analyst noted some of the disappointments were due to special bank charges and earnings from companies with November quarter-end were generally solid.

2024-05-29T17:12:30Z,SCHW,"T+1 settlement took effect Tuesday, replacing the prior T+2 system, and financial institutions are adapting to the new standard.
In brief, the shift to T+1 shortens the settlement cycle for all security transactions from two business days to one. 
The transition to T+1 was prompted by the 2021 trading frenzy around meme stocks like GameStop Corp. which highlighted the need to reduce counterparty risk and enhance capital efficiency and liquidity in securities transactions, according to Reuters. 
This change mandated by the Security Exchange Commission has wide-reaching implications for investors and financial institutions alike.
Though promising greater convenience, the T+1 settlement system also presents new challenges and requires adjustments to existing processes and strategies.
U.S, brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shared a statement with Benzinga on how this transition will impact its operations and the trading activities of its clients.
